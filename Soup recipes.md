Additionally, while some restaurant soup is pretty tasty, like [Olive Garden's crowd-favorite Zuppa Toscana](https://www.thetakeout.com/1746126/best-olive-garden-soup-zuppa-toscana/), you can really make most restaurant soups at home. For example, love Panera's broccoli cheddar soup? You can [make a copycat Panera broccoli cheddar soup at home](https://www.thetakeout.com/1717406/copycat-panera-broccoli-cheddar-soup-recipe/) in a half an hour. Crave O'Charley's loaded potato soup? Again, you can make it at home with [a copycat O'Charley's loaded potato soup recipe](https://www.mashed.com/437478/copycat-ocharleys-loaded-potato-soup-recipe/) and have it on the table in under one hour.
