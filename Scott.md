# Scott
Both Scott & Loa have heart issues. His was a small stroke at the time of his treatment in Mexico.

When I reported that [Lydia](Lydia.md) and I had enough bonding time for her to say to me that she hated me (and Mary Pat). Also that she knew that I had been her favorite. Scott scoffed somewhat, saying that by age 32 it was time enough that she should have been able to come to terms with things. I reported that even after his father's suicide, he was able to put distance between them, leaving it as his father's business. By 18 y/o he thought he was emotionally separating. Consider that Lydia is stuck.
