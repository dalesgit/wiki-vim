- "Take up the whole armor of God …"
- Pray in the Spirit at all times …"

## Outline
### The ark
A curiosity I never thought about until I tried to teach students about the sacred and the holy.

- set apart from the ordinary -- but made up of ordinary stuff
- partly controllable and partly not

It is the ark that begins the readings today. The "house" of God. We think, "How quaint." 

Last week we heard how Solomon succeeded his father David and received the gift of wisdom. We don't hear about the building of the "house" of God. 

- He cut down the forests of cedars of Lebanon
- He enlisted an army -- 30,000 the text says -- of slaves to build it.  "Solomon also had 70,000 common laborers, 80,000 quarry workers in the hill country, 16 and 3,600 foremen to supervise the work. 17 At the king’s command, they quarried large blocks of high-quality stone and shaped them to make the foundation of the Temple."

But as we listen today we hear that even with all of this grand construction, there is recognition that "God cannot be contained".

## The Sacred

- The beauty of this place, the money invested, the upkeep
- "Show me a man's checkbook and I'll show you where his heart is."
- Desire to set aside a place in my home -- only partly works.
- Jan. 6, 2020 seemed like something holy had been desecrated. **Reactivity** is a way to recognize when someone crosses someone else's sacred boundary.
