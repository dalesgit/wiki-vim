**King Alfred the Great, King of Wessex**

Alfred the Great's Feast Day is celebrated on October 26th.

> Sovereign Lord, you brought your servant Alfred to a troubled throne that he might establish peace in a ravaged land and revive learning and the arts among the people:Awake in us also a keen desire to increase our understanding while we are in this world, and an eager longing to reach that endless life where all will be made clear; through Jesus Christ out Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen**.
