> Use the Google Play Store

---
Here are some ways to install APKs on a Chromebook:

-   Use the Google Play Store
    
    Make sure your ChromeOS is up to date, then get the Google Play Store app. Open the Play Store from the Launcher, browse apps, or search for a specific app. Select the app and click Install. If prompted, review and accept the requested permissions.
    
-   Use the Linux terminal
    
    Launch the Linux terminal, then type `adb install` followed by the name of the app you want to install. Once installed, you can run the app from the Launcher.
    
-   Use the open source chromeos-apk
    
    Download an official app from the Chrome Web Store, then download the APK you want to install. Load the APK as an unpacked extension by going to chrome://apps and launching it. You can also convert APKs manually.
