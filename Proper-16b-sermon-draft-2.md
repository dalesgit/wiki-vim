# Notes 

- The beauty of this place, the money invested, the upkeep
- "Show me a man's checkbook and I'll show you where his heart is."
- Desire to set aside a place in my home -- only partly works.
- Jan. 6, 2020 seemed like something holy had been desecrated. **Reactivity** is a way to recognize when someone crosses someone else's sacred boundary.
- One of the best things asked of me, many years ago, "Is that a ditch you want to die in?"
- What is worth fighting for? It varies from person to person. 
- But there is a consistency about somethings, e.g. **The Temple Mount** -- for 3,000 years it's a place people were prepared to fight and die for.
- Story of *Koko Crater*
- cemeteries -- why not similar for births?
- Sacred cup of coffee

#  Opening 

One of the most important books of my college years was titled *Either Or; a fragment of life*. It was a foundational text for the emergence of what came to be known as existentialism. It was an important tool for me to finding a path toward spiritual growth and faith. Ultimately it was important in my decision to embrace the Christian path to -- as I put it -- to **follow it as far as its mystical riches could be mined**.

Maybe a decade later, I was challenged by a different sort of phrase. I encountered theologians who wanted to de-emphasize **either or** and argued that Jesus proclaimed something more like **both and**. I first heard about the phrase in the context of Jesus's proclamation that the **Kingdom of God was at hand**. Was the coming Kingdom that Jesus preached already accomplished with the resurrection? Or was it still in the future? The New testament seems to argue both positions. So these teachers made the case that Jesus was proclaiming a gospel where one needed to live as if the final accomplishment was already here. It is **already but not yet**. 

I encountered the significance of this kind of thinking in conversations about who should be allowed to receive communion at the Eucharist. The official Roman Catholic position was that we ought not to share communion until we have accomplished significant unity. I was myself persuaded by the argument that it is by sharing a sacred meal that we grow into significant unity - becoming a family. But I want to talk about today, what I think is present in the scriptures before us, is **already but not yet** - **paradox** at the heart of God's work in our world. 

# The Temple

 Solomon has become the king of Israel. He and his father reigned over a United Kingdom, but with Solomon's death that Kingdom splintered into parts. But in our first reading today we're at the beginning of Solomon's reign. We skipped over between last week and this week the building of the Temple. God had denied that privilege to David because of David's sin. The reading last week emphasized Solomon's request for wisdom which was granted him. This week we hear a kind of dedication of that Temple with the bringing of the ark. 

- He cut down the forests of cedars of Lebanon -- an ecological disaster that is still felt up to the present day.
- He enlisted an army -- 30,000 the text says -- of slaves to build it.  "Solomon also had 70,000 common laborers, 80,000 quarry workers in the hill country, 16 and 3,600 foremen to supervise the work. 17 At the king’s command, they quarried large blocks of high-quality stone and shaped them to make the foundation of the Temple."

But as we listen today we hear that even with all of this grand construction, there is a recognition that "God cannot be contained". … That's important. If it's true it's important.

This Ark had been with the people for many years. It had held the tablets given to Moses and it's construction had been described in the opening books of the Bible, Exodus and Deuteronomy among others. It had enormous significance to the people of Israel. It was the most sacred object of all. Solomon has now constructed a new sacred object, the temple. A sacred space to contain a sacred object. The sacred object of the ark is reflected down to the present day by the cabinet or doors that hold the scrolls of the Torah in a Jewish synagogue.

# The Sacred

I first began to think seriously about the ark in my religion class at Winthrop University. In the opening days of this particular class I coached the students through agreeing upon a tentative definition of what sacred means. What does it mean for something to be sacred? It's something that we in the church seem to take for granted but it's not as easy to say exactly what it is. The basic definition we arrived at: 

1. Something that is set apart in some way from ordinary things 
2. Something that has an effect on the well-being of the people who recognize it as sacred 
3. It is something that human beings have some control over and in some ways have no control 

It was the latter piece that drew me to pay attention to the ark of the covenant. It was precisely the behavior of the ancient Israelites and there are of the covenant that was the chief example of what was meant by being partly in control and partly out of control. You see the armies between Israel and the Philistines bothered for control of the ark. When the armies who had possession of the ark thought they invariably had victory. If they lost control of the ark they would experience defeat. 

# Paradox

It turns out that the sacred is at heart paradoxical. It is made out of ordinary things but somehow set apart from ordinary things. The sacred is somehow available to us. We can see it feel it and touch it. But what makes it sacred we have no control over at all. God is in charge of that. God cannot be contained.

How might things be different if learned to live more comfortably in a world of "Already/but not yet"? It is so often among us **black and white**, either/or. What if we lived as if God cannot be contained by "us/them"?

In our prayer last week, Mary Pat and I read of a little piece about liturgy that resonated with both of us. It was in *Common Prayer; a liturgy for ordinary radicals.*

# Song: Sacrifice of praise

> There is an old saying many Christians use: “Offer the Lord a sacrifice of praise,” referring to Hebrews 13:15. In many circles this notion of a “sacrifice of praise” almost becomes cliché. (Perhaps because worship does not often come at much cost, especially compared with the sacrifices of saints who’ve gone before us.) But when we worship with folks of various traditions, there are times when we may hear a prayer that uses language we might not naturally use or sing a song that isn’t really our style. That is part of what it means to be a member of a community as diverse as the church is. And perhaps that also helps shed some light on why it might require some sacrifice for us to give up ourselves.

> When a song isn’t working for you, consider praising God, because that probably means it is working for someone else who is very different from you. Offer your worship as a sacrifice rather than requiring others to sacrifice for your pleasure or contentment. There is something to the notion of becoming one as God is one; it doesn’t mean that we are the same; it just means that we are united by one Spirit. After all, we can become one only if there are many of us to begin with.

> Liturgy puts a brake on narcissism. Certainly, there is something beautiful about contemporary worship, where we can take old things and add a little spice to them, like singing hymns to rock tunes or reciting creeds as spoken word rhymes. But liturgy protects us from simply making worship into a self-pleasing act. So if a song or prayer doesn’t quite work for you, be thankful that it is probably really resonating with someone who is different from you, and offer a sacrifice of praise.

# I am the bread of life

We have concluded an extended reading over several weeks from the passage in John's Gospel were he proclaims himself "The Bread of Life." The people who heard him were scandalized. They asked, "How can he say that?" We have those same kind of conversations today. There is a contemporary hymn in our hymnal, #335 *I am the bread of life*. There are those for whom that is a powerful hymn. And there are those who don't. What if the whole point of life is that we're supposed to experience what doesn't work for us -- since it does work for others. 

What if the sacred can truly be experienced in the ordinary? Most of my adult life I have experienced the "bread of life" in the Eucharist with real bread, bread that was made by members of the congregation. Ordinary bread. Ordinary bread made sacred in the sharing of a sacred meal. What if we really believed that God cannot be contained?
