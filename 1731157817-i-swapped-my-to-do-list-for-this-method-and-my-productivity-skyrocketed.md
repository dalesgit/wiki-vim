To-do lists are a great way to stay on top of tasks, but sometimes, they can become overwhelming and cause more stress than productivity. Interstitial journaling is an effective productivity method that overcomes some of the limitations of traditional to-do lists while improving productivity.

## What Is Interstitial Journaling and Why Is it Effective?

Interstitial journaling is a simple yet effective practice of writing short journal entries throughout the day. It comes from the term "interstice," which refers to a small space or gap. In this context, it's about using these gaps throughout the day—during breaks or when transitioning to different tasks—for writing brief reflections and ideas.

One of the main reasons interstitial journaling is so effective is that it combines elements of journaling, note-taking, task management, and time tracking into a single streamlined process. So, instead of tracking work with a to-do list, you're doing so with a journal by recording the current time, and thoughts about what you just worked on and what you plan to do next.

Here are some of the benefits of using interstitial journaling (and common to-do list limitations that it helps overcome):

### Less Context Switching

Although useful, traditional to-do lists often fall short when it comes to managing the [productivity drain that comes with context switching](https://www.makeuseof.com/context-switching-sabotaging-productivity-what-you-can-do/). That's because attention doesn’t function like an on-off switch. Each time you shift focus from one task to the next, part of your attention lingers on what you were doing before. Interstitial journaling tackles this issue by helping you take reflective breaks to declutter your mind between tasks and offloading those lingering thoughts onto your journal.

### Fewer Distractions

Another significant benefit is how it helps reduce distractions. For example, knowing that I have to log everything, including doomscrolling through social media, forces me to be more intentional and think twice before getting sidetracked.

### Less Anxiety

In addition, interstitial journaling helps me [overcome procrastination and start working on my goals](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating-start-working-goals/). That's because to-do list items are often vague. Journaling tasks forces me to be more specific, which helps reduce the anxiety of not knowing where to start.

### Promotes Mindfulness

Last but not least, interstitial journaling promotes mindfulness. Unlike traditional journaling, which tends to happen at set times once or twice a day, interstitial journaling occurs throughout the day, providing a lightweight and repetitive ritual that helps me track what I'm doing and how I feel.

In a nutshell, interstitial journaling is an effective habit that can significantly improve your productivity and overall well-being. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started with interstitial journaling:

Interstitial journalling is simple—it doesn’t require fancy tools or a complex setup. It is generally best to use the tool you are most comfortable with and is easily accessible to you, as you will use it throughout the day. So, this can be a notebook or a physical journal. However, if you prefer a digital approach, there are several [note-taking apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/note-taking-apps-to-access-on-any-device/) or dedicated journaling tools that you can use on your phone or computer.

If you go the digital route and are looking for a tool suited specifically for interstitial journaling, consider using [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), as it provides some unique features tailored for this purpose, including time stamping and referencing. Time stamping helps you keep an accurate log of your day, which can be valuable for reviewing your progress later. Referencing, on the other hand, allows you to link your entries together, providing a more comprehensive overview of your thoughts and activities.

Don't worry if you use a physical notebook or your existing digital tool lacks this feature, as you can always add timestamps manually. Similarly, interstitial journaling does not have to replace your existing productivity system; in fact, it can complement it. You can still use a task management app or a calendar to keep track of your tasks and appointments while using interstitial journaling to add an extra layer of reflection by writing what you just worked on, how it went, and what’s next.

## Step 2: Journal During Key Transitions

Identifying interstitial moments or recognizing transitional gaps in your day for reflection is crucial for incorporating this journaling technique into your routine. Instead of jumping from one task to the next without pause, this technique encourages you to offload thoughts, refocus, and plan your next move with intention. Here are some key interstitial moments you can utilize throughout your day:

### After Completing a Task

Once you finish a task, take a brief moment to reflect and record your thoughts. This allows you to process the task fully before moving on to the next, which helps clear your mind and better prepare for what’s next.

### Before Starting a Task

Before diving into a to-do, write what you’re about to work on and how you plan to approach it. This helps you mentally shift gears and focus on what’s coming. In addition, it helps you clearly define the task and your expectations for it, which can reduce anxiety.

### During Breaks

Breaks are essential for staying productive, and they’re also great for reflection. Use breaks to quickly journal what you’ve been working on, what you are grateful for, or how you feel. This can be a good mental reset, allowing you to return to work with a refreshed mind.

### Review Regularly

One of the things that makes interstitial journaling so effective is that it builds a personal log of your workday. Set time aside at the end of the day or during the weekend to review your notes. For example, you may notice that you are more productive during specific periods of the day or you’re frequently distracted at certain times. This awareness can help you adjust to your schedule or work habits for better productivity.

## Step 3: Decide What to Record

One of the main goals of interstitial journaling is to empty your brain, similar to the capture phase in David Allen's [Getting Things Done (GTD) method](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-i-use-the-gtd-getting-things-done-method/). Multitasking (or context switching) is bad for productivity, so the idea is to get things out of your head so you’re not carrying mental baggage into your next task. This makes transitions smoother and reduces distractions.

Considering you may only have small gaps or interstitial moments in your schedule, writing long and trivial entries may not be practical or useful—keeping it short and to the point is the secret to making it sustainable. Here’s what I focus on:

### The Current Time

First, I write down the current time. This is a quick and easy way to track when transitions happen and how long tasks take. For example, if I just finished writing an article at 11:00 AM, I’ll note that down. Timestamping each entry also helps me see patterns in my workday and how I allocate time for different tasks.

### The Previous Task

Next, I write what I just finished working on and how I feel about it. This step is important because it helps me reflect on my work and offload any lingering thoughts or ideas from the previous task so I’m not mentally stuck on it while moving to the next one.

For example:

> I finished writing the article on interstitial journaling. Initially, I struggled a bit with organizing my thoughts, but once I wrote the introduction, it flowed smoothly.

### The Next Action

![Interstitial journaling in Logseq](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/logseq-interstitial-journaling-1.png)

Being specific here is crucial—it turns vague intentions into actionable steps that make it less intimidating. Instead of writing something broad like “work on the blog,” I’ll get specific, such as “brainstorm ideas for next week’s blog post.”

### Random Reflections or Distractions

Finally, if I have any random ideas that could be useful for future tasks, I’ll jot them down. If I got distracted or sidetracked during the previous task, I’ll also note it. Sometimes, knowing I will have to write that I spent 20 minutes scrolling through Instagram keeps me from getting sidetracked in the first place. These reflections help me stay focused and accountable for my time management.

The key to making interstitial journaling work is consistency. Once it becomes a habit, you will enjoy the benefits of increased productivity and mindfulness. Plus, reviewing your notes regularly can help you identify any inefficiencies in your workflow and make necessary adjustments. Try it and see how it works for you!
