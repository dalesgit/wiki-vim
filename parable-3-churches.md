As DioHI gathers for its 56th Annual Convention, and the Episcopal Church writ large prepares to welcome and enthrone a new Presiding Bishop, some observations about the current state of affairs in the Episcopal Church were brought into focus last week during a Tribal business trip to Northern California.

The annual Shasta Nation Tribal gathering brought this writer and companion to Southern Oregon and Northern California during the first week of October.  In Klamath Falls we visited St Paul's Episcopal Church, which has disbanded and has its property for sale.  In Yreka for the gathering, we visited St Mark's Episcopal Church which has disbanded and turned its beautiful wood/gothic buildings over to the City of Yreka as a "venue" for the performing arts.  In contrast, en route to Medford Airport on Sunday the 6th, we worshipped at Trinity  Episcopal Church in Ashland, Oregon. The latter is more than a Century old and is situated in downtown Ashland, a short distance from the famous hotel and Shakespeare Festival.  The buildings and grounds are immaculate.  The worship was "good, solid, Episcopal worship", with music from the largest choir ever seen in an Episcopal Church - - - about 30% of the congregation!  The congregation was about 70 people, 90% with white or silver hair.  One teen was in a pew with parents.

Is this sad news or a negative observation?  Not necessarily.

In the case of St Paul's in Klamath Falls, this congregation grew during the "lumbering chapter" of Klamath Falls history.  After cutting the trees and closing the lumber mill, Klamath Falls began to undergo economic and situational changes.  St Paul's remained solidly with folks who were aging, retiring, moving, or passing away.  It did not address the nearby KLAMATH/MODOC/YAHUSKIN Indian community, nor the  growing Hispanic population numbers.  The post lumber mill population grew increasingly conservative politically and were attracted, if at all, to a "box church."  It can be noted, however, that an ACNA congregation still meets in a store front on Main Street.

Yreka, California was the "capital" of the State of Jefferson, a secessionist movement in the 1930's which did not actually happen, as well as the County Seat of Siskiyou County, and home to the Shasta Nation of Northern California.  It was originally a "gold rush town," with thousands of greedy, white males pouring into the frontier town in the 1850's, shortly after California statehood.  As the gold was depleted, farming took over with irrigation of the Northern California dry fields a requirement.  St Mark's Episcopal Church was founded in Downtown Yreka, and built, then rebuilt, a beautiful wood building, parish hall, and rectory.  In 2015, however, the congregation "gave up" and closed permanently.  Again as with Klamath Falls, the church in Yreka was "mired" in a disappearing past.

Ashland, Oregon is a unique island of interesting culture in the SW corner of the State.  Southern Oregon University is located there, Jefferson Public Radio is part of SOU, and of course, the world famous Shakespeare Festival is flourishing.  To find a vibrant Episcopal Church in the heart of Downtown is heartening.  The caveat, however, of "white hair" should concern the new Rector there.

The Episcopal Church need not "die out," but it must consider some systemic changes.  We Episcopalians must address not only the African-American population, which remains static at 11% of the National population, but must work to reach the growing Hispanic population (even in Hawai'i!).  The percentage of Asians in the USA is also growing.  Hawai'i might smugly suggest we have significant Asian membership, and some leadership, in DioHI.....after all, Bishop Chang was local Chinese.  However, Hawai'i population is growing with immigrant arrivals, not from internal self sustaining numbers.

The leadership elected this weekend at Convention needs to look beyond a "keep on, keeping on" mentality and determine exactly where and how ministerial energy will be expended through the "20's".
