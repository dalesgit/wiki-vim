Thursday morning prayer
Psalm 143

Let morning announce your love, my God, for it is you I trust.

Hear me, faithful Lord! bend to my prayer, show compassion.

Do not judge me harshly; in your sight, no one is just.

My enemy hunts me down, grinding me to dust, caging me with the dead in lasting darkness.

My strength drains away, my heart is numb.

I remember the ancient days, I recall your wonders, the work of your hands.

Dry as thirsty land, I reach out for you.

Answer me quickly, Lord.

My strength is spent.

Do not hide from me or I will fall into the grave.

Let morning announce your love, for it is you I trust.

Show me the right way, I offer you myself.

Rescue me from my foes, you are my only refuge, Lord.

Teach me your will, for you are my God.

Graciously lead me, Lord, on to level ground.

I call on your just name, keep me safe, free from danger.

In your great love for me, disarm my enemies, destroy their power, for I belong to you. D

Psalm 147:1-11

How good to sing God praise!

How lovely the sound!

How good to sing God praise!

How lovely the sound!

The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem and gathers the exiles of Israel, healing the brokenhearted, binding their aching wounds.

God fixes the number of stars, calling each by name.

Great is our God and powerful, wise beyond all telling.

The Lord upholds the poor but lets the wicked fall.

Sing thanks to the Lord, sound the harp for our God.

The Lord stretches the clouds, sending rain to the earth, clothing mountains with green.

The Lord feeds the cattle and young ravens when they call.

A horse's strength, a runner's speed - they count for nothing!

The Lord favors the reverent, those who trust in God's mercy. â€¢
