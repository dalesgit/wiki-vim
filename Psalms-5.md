## Thursday morning prayer

### Psalm 143

Let morning announce your love, my God, for it is you I trust.
Hear me, faithful Lord! bend to my prayer, show compassion.
Do not judge me harshly; in your sight, no one is just.
My enemy hunts me down, grinding me to dust, caging me with the dead in lasting darkness.
My strength drains away, my heart is numb.
I remember the ancient days, I recall your wonders, the work of your hands.
Dry as thirsty land, I reach out for you.
Answer me quickly, Lord.
My strength is spent.
Do not hide from me or I will fall into the grave.
Let morning announce your love, for it is you I trust.
Show me the right way, I offer you myself.
Rescue me from my foes, you are my only refuge, Lord.
Teach me your will, for you are my God.
Graciously lead me, Lord, on to level ground.
I call on your just name, keep me safe, free from danger.
In your great love for me, disarm my enemies, destroy their power, for I belong to you. D

### Psalm 147:1-11

How good to sing God praise!
How lovely the sound!
How good to sing God praise!
How lovely the sound!
The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem and gathers the exiles of Israel, healing the brokenhearted, binding their aching wounds.
God fixes the number of stars, calling each by name.
Great is our God and powerful, wise beyond all telling.
The Lord upholds the poor but lets the wicked fall.
Sing thanks to the Lord, sound the harp for our God.
The Lord stretches the clouds, sending rain to the earth, clothing mountains with green.
The Lord feeds the cattle and young ravens when they call.
A horse's strength, a runner's speed - they count for nothing!
The Lord favors the reverent, those who trust in God's mercy. •
Thursday evening prayer

### Psalm 144:1-8

God, my love, my shield, my refuge, you give me victory.
Praise God, God my rock who trains my hands for battle, my arms for war.
God, my love, my safety, my stronghold and defender, God, my shield, my refuge, you give me victory.
Who are we that you care for us?
Why give a thought to mortals?
We are little more than breath; our days, fleeting shadows.
Come, Lord, lower the heavens, touch the mountains, let them spew out smoke.
Strike lightning, let your arrows fly, scatter my enemies in terror.
Reach down from the heavens, snatch me from crashing waves; rescue me from strangers who speak lies
and then swear to them. •

### Psalm 144:1-15

You bless us with great gifts, our God, our joy.
I sing you a new song, Lord, I play my ten-stringed harp, for you give victory to kings, you rescue your servant, David.
Save me from the bitter sword, deliver me from strangers, who speak lies
and then swear to them.
God, you shape our sons like tall, sturdy plants; you sculpt our daughters like pillars for a palace.
You fill our barns with all kinds of food, you bless our fields with sheep by the thousands and fatten all our cattle.
There is no breach in the walls, no outcry in the streets, no exile.
We are a people blest with these gifts, blest with the Lord as our God! •

## Friday Morning Prayer

### Psalm 51

Creator, reshape my heart, God, steady my spirit.
Have mercy, tender God, forget that I defied you.
Wash away my sin, cleanse me from my guilt.
I know my evil well, it stares me in the face, evil done to you alone before your very eyes.
How right your condemnation!
Your verdict clearly just.
You see me for what I am, a sinner before my birth.
You love those centered in truth; teach me your hidden wisdom.
Wash me with fresh water, wash me bright as snow.
Fill me with happy songs,
let the bones you bruised now dance.
Shut your eyes to my sin, make my guilt disappear.
Creator, reshape my heart, God, steady my spirit.
Do not cast me aside stripped of your holy spirit.
Save me, bring back my joy, support me, strengthen my will.
Then I will teach your way and sinners will turn to you.
Help me, stop my tears, and I will sing your goodness.
Lord, give me words
and I will shout your praise.
When I offer a holocaust, the gift does not please you.
So I offer my shattered spirit; a changed heart you welcome.
In your love make Zion lovely, rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
Then sacrifice will please you, young bulls upon your altar. o

### Psalm 147:12-20

Praise the Lord with song, O Zion, for God speaks to the earth and the word speeds forth.
Jerusalem, give glory!
Praise God with song, O Zion!
For the Lord strengthens your gates guarding your children within.
The Lord fills your land with peace, giving you golden wheat.
God speaks to the earth, the word speeds forth.
The Lord sends heavy snow and scatters frost like ashes.
The Lord hurls chunks of hail.
Who can stand such cold?
God speaks, the ice melts;
God breathes, the streams flow.
God speaks his word to Jacob, to Israel, his laws and decrees.
God has not done this for others, no others receive this wisdom.
Hallelujah!o

## Friday evening prayer

### Psalm 145:1-13b

I will bless you every day
and ponder your wonderful works.
I will exalt you, God my king, for ever bless your name.
I will bless you every day, for ever praise your name.
Great is the Lord, highly to be praised, great beyond our reach.
Age to age proclaims your works, recounts your mighty deeds.
I ponder your splendor and glory and all your wonderful works.
They reveal your fearful power, I tell of your great deeds.
They recall your ample goodness, joyfully sing your justice.
Gracious and merciful is the Lord, slow to anger, full of love.
The Lord is good in every way, merciful to every creature.
Let your works praise you, Lord, your faithful ones bless you.
Let them proclaim your glorious reign, let them tell of your might.
Let them make known to all your might and glorious reign.
Your dominion lasts for ever, your rule for all generations! •

### Psalm 145:13c-21

The eyes of all look to you, Lord; you are near to those who call.
The Lord is faithful in every word and gracious in every work.
The Lord supports the fallen, raises those bowed down.
The eyes of all look to you, you give them food in due time.
You open wide your hand to feed all living things.
The Lord is just in every way, loving in every deed.
The Lord is near to those who call, who cry out from their hearts.
God grants them their desires, hears their cry and saves them.
Those who love God are kept alive; the wicked, the Lord destroys.
I will sing the Lord's praise, let all flesh bless God's Name, holy, both now and for ever. D

## Saturday Morning Prayer

### Psalm 92

How good to thank you, Lord, to sing your love at dawn.
How good to thank you, Lord, to praise your name, Most High, to sing your love at dawn, your faithfulness at dusk with sound of lyre and harp, with music of the lute.
For your work brings delight, your deeds invite song.
I marvel at what you do.
Lord, how deep your thought!
Fools do not grasp this, nor the senseless understand.
Scoundrels spring up like grass, flourish and quickly wither.
You, Lord, stand firm for ever.
See how your enemies perish, scattered to the winds,
while you give me brute strength, pouring rich oil upon me.
I have faced my enemies, heard them plot against me.
The just grow tall like palm trees, majestic like the cedars of Lebanon.
They are planted in the temple courts and flourish in God's house, green and heavy with fruit even in old age.
Proclaim that God is just, my rock without a fault. o

### Psalm 8

Even the babble of infants declares your strength, O God.
Lord our God, the whole world tells the greatness of your name.
Your glory reaches beyond the stars.
Even the babble of infants declares your strength, your power to halt the enemy and avenger.
I see your handiwork in the heavens:
the moon and the stars you set in place.
What is humankind that you remember them, the human race
that you care for them?
You treat them like gods, dressing them in glory and splendor.
You give them charge of the earth, laying all at their feet:
cattle and sheep, wild beasts,
birds of the sky, fish of the sea,
every swimming creature.
Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, who shepherds the people and sets them free...
