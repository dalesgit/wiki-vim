## What I know

- Dorothy Day's phrase "[The duty of delight](The duty of delight.md)" (wonder & awe), like children

## Spell it out

##  [journal/2024-08-29.md](journal/2024-08-29.md) On John the Baptist.

[MP.md](MP.md) was impressed with my little homily. I linked Charles Carroll, my first spiritual director, that his theology/philosophy strayed from mine (abortion). But he made me who I am as a Christian. E.g. also He and Polly's commitment to pray together. Then, as he asked, "Where is the Good News?" so I ask questions at every turn. It is all about the questions. Then, the good news (cf. the *Benedictus Dominus*) is that John was the first spiritual director of Jesus. They're not the same. One superseded the other. But one wouldn't be without the other.
