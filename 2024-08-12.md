# Gratitude Journal 

- [/dream.md](/dream.md) about [Lydia](/Lydia.md). Or just unable to sleep for thinking about Lydia. I came up with the list of people in my circle/family who are estranged:
    - Jacob from his mother (somehow Lydia took the blame)
    - Shirley from her siblings
    - me from Emma & Lydia
- I surely don't know what to do about that. "Lord, I've truly done the best I could." Here I am at almost 74 years. I've lived longer than I imagined I would for most of my years, based on the model of my father. Mo, Mary Pat, Bridget, we all lost our fathers too young.
