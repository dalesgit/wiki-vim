*Reflection for Spiritual Direction Course*

1. I notice‚Ä¶(awareness) that I felt like I was name dropping, pompous, showing off at the session yesterday. I saw Linda's face as I said I wasn't doing this for "professional development", trying to go on to say it was for deep personal questions of **who I am** and __why I am here__. Her face seemed to show disappointment and disapproval.

2. I‚Äôm curious about‚Ä¶ Why I fell into the role I was relating the other day to MP or someone about my contrarian actions in College, e.g. when I felt like Harvey Rabin was going to get up and punch me.  (attentive exploration) 
3. I wonder how I can‚Ä¶ (active response) Be respectful but not worry about approval for figures in authority?

Linda: Thank you for sharing that with me. Using archetype language- isn‚Äôt it true that we all have (no matter what our age) a child, a parent and a wise elder within us? The child is free, full of dreams, explorative, but vulnerable in those places.  The parent is the one trying to keep the child safe- do this, not that, be this, not that.  The protector.  In what you describe here, I see both protector parent emerging (fear of fitting in) and the rebellious one (I don‚Äôt need to fit in anyway but secretly want to)  Perhaps let the wise elder speak to both of them.  What does he want to say to the child?  To the parent?  He knows plenty and can put them both at ease. üôèüèº‚ô•Ô∏è

Glad you are with us
