*Reflection for Spiritual Direction Course*

1. I notice…(awareness) that I felt like I was name dropping, pompous, showing off at the session yesterday. I saw Linda's face as I said I wasn't doing this for "professional development", trying to go on to say it was for deep personal questions of **who I am** and __why I am here__. Her face seemed to show disappointment and disapproval.

2. I’m curious about… Why I fell into the role I was relating the other day to MP or someone about my contrarian actions in College, e.g. when I felt like Harvey Rabin was going to get up and punch me.  (attentive exploration) 
3. I wonder how I can… (active response) Be respectful but not worry about approval for figures in authority?
