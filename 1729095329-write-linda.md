Linda, I so appreciate the video of the session I missed last week. The questions and inquiries I had with the readings were more than adequately addressed. Right from the beginning I had to agree that "language" was a noticeable "issue" that stood out for me. Not that it was a barrier, but it felt like a kind of "jargon" that I wasn't familiar with. Then, I was utterly unfamiliar with "Peformance Theory". I just figured I had missed that it my educational wanderings. It felt something like the use made of **anthropology** in my early theological studies. I suspect it might a little bit similar to my experiential discoveries 15 years ago that **acting**, as in drama, had a lot to do with liturgy -- also with teaching. We will be returning to Palm Harbor this afternoon and expect to see you tomorrow.
