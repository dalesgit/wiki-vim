# Account of my life

I have recently completed 100 page or so autobiography, memoir intended to share with my siblings and children. So that document is available with anyone feel so inclined.

I am now 73 years old. A summary of my life is mother rather more like a baobab tree Santa Christmas tree. It occurred to me that one pass into an overview of my life was to identify the people who were heroes at various times throughout these seven decades.

## Heroes

- I have two early heroes from about the same time in my life. Several of my children referred to this as the "single digits." At a summer Bible camp session when I was still quite young the memoir of Dale Evans was read to us. In it she recounted the experience of having a Down's syndrome child who died at a tender age. *Angel Unaware*. Dale Evans ultimately experienced the all-too-short life of Robin as a profound gift from God. 
	- At about the same time my parents took us to the church Grange building to watch a movie about the new Nobel prize that had been offered to Albert Schweitzer. I thought at the time that this man must be a saint as well as a genius. I would learn more about him through my 20s and 30s in graduate school in theology and in my efforts to be an instrument maker, including organs.
- Along with more mundane heroes of adolescence, baseball players especially, there were several scientists that captivated my imagination. Joseph Lister the physician. Nicola Tesla the genius electric theorist. Robert Oppenheimer the brilliant head of the Manhattan Project who was also a practitioner of Asian Religions. In my final year of High School I encountered T.S. Eliot. I have been unable to shake down to the present day.
- The most passionate "hero" of my 20s was a contemporary of Eliot. Ezra Pound. It was he more than anyone who taught me the power and luminescence of language. He was alienating, seemingly a genius, got many things wrong, but -- I would wager -- found himself ushered into the great Elysium. 
- Beginning in my 20s and then for many years after, religious figures dominated my "heroes".
	- Nicholas Ferrar
	- Mother Teresa (and the author who introduced her to the world; Malcolm Muggeridge)
	- Charles de Foucauld
	- Carlo Carretto
- Probably dozens more could be added to represent my active years in ministry, 1983-2012.
- I ask myself who are the heroes of my twilight years? Harry Chapin comes to mind, the singer-songwriter who, like Jesus died all too young. Pete Seeger, a friend of Chapin's, reflects for me something of what I admire about growing old. For a short period of time in my younger days Zorba the Greek was a fictional hero after whom I wanted to model my life. It was a spiritual director who showed me that I was far more like the narrator in that novel than the main character. True heroes for me are all those who have been occasion for those kinds of insights in my own life. 
- I am committed to life-long learning. I'm not where I want to be in the fashioning of a life, though I've come a long way. But, at least in some ways, I can see that I've reflected, however crudely, the image of a life-long hero: Jesus of Nazareth.


## Family

I was born into a medical family. My father was a physician and my mother was a nurse. I was born in the mountains of Arizona, because my father was the doctor for a copper mining company. While still young my father moved us to the Denver area where I grew up and went to school. I had two brothers and one sister. One of the things I learned through decades of pastoral ministry is that everyone's family is remarkable, noted for dysfunction as well as health, worthy of a great novel and ordinary -- like everybody else. Not until I was nearly 70 did I learn that I had an older sister. I've corresponded with her but never met her. Obviously there are stories there to be told.

My parents were divorced in my early adolescence. I know that in both straightforward ways and mystically twisted ways there a divorce had an impact on my own life. I have been divorced twice and married three times. My current wife and I have been married since 2012. I have 5 children that I have fathered in 2 of the marriages. Interestingly, my best relationships are with the 2 children of my current wife. They feel like my children.

I experienced my divorces as a kind of death, and from them I experienced a wide range of grieving responses. The alienations engendered in all of that have led to one difficult relationship with a daughter and one broken relationship with a daughter, both of them with my 2nd wife. I have experienced that as a death of sorts, and my reactions and responses continue, even though in many ways I have found ways to go on with my life. 
# Development of my religious life

I have already given some clear indications about how one might begin to understand the development of my religious life. From a young age I have felt a kinship with Jesus and God and all that might go hand-in-hand with that. In some ways a place that on the lap of my grandmother who was devoted to her Methodist church and happily shared stories and prayers with us. Around the time of my parents divorce I had a keen sense that those stories and and the ways that had been taught me in the church of my youth were not sufficient to sustain me. My mother was looking for a church that could support her during the time of separation and divorce from my father. She found her way to the episcopal church. I remember to this day what I felt as I was introduced to a more sacramentally oriented church than I had known. The words that I used to describe my experience had to do with a shared common cup and the candles that were lit with actual flames. I said that it felt like "real church". I rather think that I've been looking for the real church ever since.

Like countless others, my 20s were spent searching for who I was and what I was sent for, how to make a living, how to find some satisfaction in the life I was seeking. I found my way back to the church through the friendship of a retired priest who is doing research at the library I worked out. Over many hours and days and lunches we became friends. He was comfortable with all my talk about God and prayer and how it all fit together. It felt safe to go where he had gone before.

During this time I crave the community like I had read had developed around Little Gidding through the guidance of Nicholas Ferrar. I learned about communities of different kinds being developed by people of faith: Sojourners in Washington D.C., Catholic Worker houses, charismatic retreat centers. One thing and another and I found myself in seminary, preparing for parish ministry. Looking back, I didn't have a clue what I was doing.

I told my (Bishop) that I had a vision of doing ministry where nobody else wanted to go. Hospice chaplaincy perhaps? Small church ministry based on the working priest model? Mixing teaching and pastoral care? Ultimately my ministry has combined elements of all these things. I graduated cum laude from seminary, but halted for the time being the ordination to ministry in order to attend graduate school at Notre Dame. I felt called to both, and I have found creative ways through the decades to do both.

Finally I retired from my career as a parish priest and had a short career as an adjunct professor at several universities. Now, I am retired from all of it, ie. I'm not being paid to do it, but I still preach and celebrate, and I recognize that in many ways I'm a teacher at heart. 
# A time when I accompanied someone on their faith journey

There are so many stories I could tell, particularly because in many ways "accompanying people on their faith journey" is what I lived for these past 40+ years. One, perhaps stands out as particularly gentle and sustained.
