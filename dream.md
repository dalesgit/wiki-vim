# dream
## Wed 11 Sep 2024 
It lasted -- even through getting up to pee. I was at a funeral. It was obviously related to Mary Jean, but it also seemed to be about Dad. I had a focus because of my name. I didn't want to flaunt my identity. There were myriads of people and mostly younger than I. At one point there seemed to be a bit of nudity, including a hot tub with naked folks in it. (Was this the association with Suzanne?) But there were missing people, people who missed the information or the train or the bus or something like that. The whole affair got delayed.
