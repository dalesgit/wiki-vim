We watched a movie last night. First in a while because of the **Hurricane**. _Megan Leavey_ was the name. A familiar face (WestWing?) She ran away from her life and joined the Marines to go fight in Iraq. She was a dog handler. True story. She and the dog saved many lives. Was honored at a Yankee Stadium game. **Learning how to love**.

It was our second night without power. [MP](MP.md) was in the living room for a number of hours. The dream began as we were traveling or headed somewhere. One of our companions invited us to this "event". It was a small theater. At first I thought it was going to be a cooking show, theatrically presented. I sat quite interested, shifting to the floor, and then back into my seat.

But then the whole thing shifted. It became participatory. Suddenly we were in the play. And it seemed like one of those stories where as we made decisions the narrative incorporated our decisions. We escaped dangers. Became trapped underground. At some point I realized that we were the story -- **and I was utterly thrilled**.

I knew that the creators of the story were glad to get new participants. That was maybe the point of the whole thing. I thought of how I watched the group in London 1969 from **Scientology** work to recruit members. There I didn't want to be a part. Also the cult in the Broadmoor.

In my dream I was ecstatic and fully committed to making it work. _It seemed as if one of the results was that I was going to get to stay in Hawai'i._

We were in Hawai'i. At home there. But it all seemed to be falling apart. We are anticipating Hurricane Milton hitting us directly.

There was the usual celebration at a place like Notre Dame. It was festive. I can't remember the occasion, nor who I was with. While it's true that I didn't get to the real culmination of festivities, I was in the midst of them. Working my way into the center of celebration, cinematic.

It lasted -- even through getting up to pee. I was at a funeral. It was obviously related to Mary Jean, but it also seemed to be about Dad. I had a focus because of my name. I didn't want to flaunt my identity. There were myriads of people and mostly younger than I. At one point there seemed to be a bit of nudity, including a hot tub with naked folks in it. (Was this the association with Suzanne?) But there were missing people, people who missed the information or the train or the bus or something like that. The whole affair got delayed.
