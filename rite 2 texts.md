### 1 Lord, hear the prayers of _thy_ people; 
and what we have  asked faithfully, grant that we may obtain effectually, to the  glory of _thy_ Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen._

### 2 Heavenly Father, you have promised 
to hear what we ask in  the Name of your Son: Accept and fulfill our petitions, we  pray, not as we ask in our ignorance, nor as we deserve in our  sinfulness, but as you know and love us in your Son Jesus  Christ our Lord. _Amen._

### 3 Almighty and eternal God, ruler of all things 
in heaven and  earth: Mercifully accept the prayers of your people, and  strengthen us to do your will; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  _Amen._

### 4 Almighty God, to whom our needs are known before we ask:  
Help us to ask only what accords with your will; and those good things which we dare not, or in our blindness cannot  ask, grant us for the sake of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  _Amen._

### 5 O Lord our God, accept the fervent prayers of your people; 
in  the multitude of your mercies, look with compassion upon us  and all who turn to you for help; for you are gracious, O  lover of souls, and to you we give glory, Father, Son, and  Holy Spirit, now and for ever. _Amen._

### 6 Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, 
"Peace I give to  you; my own peace I leave with you:" Regard not our sins,  but the faith of your Church, and give to us the peace and  unity of that heavenly City, where with the Father and the  Holy Spirit you live and reign, now and for ever. _Amen._

### 7 Hasten, O Father, the coming of thy kingdom; 
and grant that  we thy servants, who now live by faith, may with joy behold  thy Son at his coming in glorious majesty; even Jesus Christ,  our only Mediator and Advocate. _Amen._

### 8 Almighty God, by your Holy Spirit you have made us one  
with your saints in heaven and on earth: Grant that in our  earthly pilgrimage we may always be supported by this  fellowship of love and prayer, and know ourselves to be  surrounded by their witness to your power and mercy. We  ask this for the sake of Jesus Christ, in whom all our  intercessions are acceptable through the Spirit, and who lives  and reigns for ever and ever. _Amen._
## Confession
*The Bishop, when present, or the Priest, stands and says*

Almighty God have mercy on you, forgive you all your sins  through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen you in all  goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep you in  eternal life. _Amen._
