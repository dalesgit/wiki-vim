Chapter 6
Neighborhood
1. Early on, Butler Bass informs us that neighbor means “near dweller” (p. 196). Do you know many of your neighbors? Who are your neighbors, and what is your relationship with them? Who has been a neighbor to you in the wider sense of the word?
2. “Neighborhoods need spiritual gathering places as much as they need schools and shops. Yet God does not live at the neighborhood church” (p. 196). What do you think the role of the neighborhood church is, and what should it be?
3. Butler Bass brings up the idea of connecting with thousands of people daily via media and social media (p.  205). Do you live in technology neighborhoods? What are the challenges of those neighborhoods?
4. “The world can no longer afford tribes intent on purity who believe God blesses only them” (p. 220). How does Butler Bass distinguish among tribes, clans, and open tribes? Who might disagree with this statement?
