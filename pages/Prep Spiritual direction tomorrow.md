## Since 1st of Nov

- Election
- My world has shifted
- Training has continued
- Lou interview
- Preach Election, Thanksgiving
- Writing scripts, organizing, spending time doing things I can control
- Mary Pat retreat, finding spiritual authority with a group of folks
- I really don't want to spend my energy on parish life
- She has told her Centering Prayer group about the reticence of Spiritual Directors to initiate
- Reading less news. Church and State (empire, tyranny)
