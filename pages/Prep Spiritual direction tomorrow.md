## Since 1st of Nov

- Election
- My world has shifted
- Training has continued
- Lou interview
- Preach Election, Thanksgiving
- Writing scripts, organizing, spending time doing things I can control
- Mary Pat retreat, finding spiritual authority with a group of folks
- I really don't want to spend my energy on parish life
- She has told her Centering Prayer group about the reticence of Spiritual Directors to initiate
- Reading less news. Church and State (empire, tyranny)
- MP doesn't know how to let me be with the depression related to election.
- MP is so expectant and hopeful. Making it difficult to share with her my ambivalence about Christmas. So much work? Sense of disappointment about it? So much sadness and alienation?
- wondering about continuing with the training? Schedule[^1] for 2025
