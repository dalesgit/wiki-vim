"How did it come to such a place as this? That we need to be reminded that it is more blessed to give than to receive? It is more blessed care for the other than to protect yourself?"

"How did we come to a place where it honesty is not valued so high as to Lord it over another?"

“Blessed are you who are poor,\
for yours is the kingdom of God.\
“Blessed are you who are hungry now,\
for you will be filled.\
“Blessed are you who weep now,\
for you will laugh.\
“Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile you, and defame you on\
account of the Son of Man. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in\
heaven; for that is what their ancestors did to the prophets."

How did we get to a place when the people do not see though they have eyes to watch the Super Bowl?

How did we get to this place when the people do not know the Spirit of the living God?

So the prophets have asked through the ages.
