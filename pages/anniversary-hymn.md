## Anniversary Hymn

A pair together down a dozen,\
a lot a little?\
Depends who's counting or\
tomorrow's dinner's waiting in the freezer.\
Preparing, planning until\
we've done it, sounding\
like old veterans.\
That's us.

Moving across the oceans and mountains,\
Becoming orphans together,\
It's oceans not mountains\
in the land of flowers.

Through a century and\
Down a millenium,\
we've grown old together.\
Imagine, the fruit of dreams,\
It should get easier\
don't you think?

Covid, O global undoing, you\
stretched what seemed possible\
and over and over again\
in these dozen years\
the impossible unfolds in front of us

Children returned as literal prodigal sons\
The breath, breathing, life returned\
in Centering Prayer, in the fellowship\
for which you've longed\
Don't hold your breath too longed\
But a daughter joined a son-in-law\
The impossible seems just within reach.

Yes, these dozen years\
have surprised,\
even in the longing,\
unanticipated the serendipity of grace,\
Retirement or not to be\
It's a process, paired with discovery\
Like the oceans we've sailed.

Surprise, it's God's language.\
Or is it math?\
Or is it silence?\
Or is it the music you hear and hold within you?

Yes, God has stalked us these dozen years.

A dozen down, many more to come?\
Still to learn about growing old together,\
What? Grow old?\
Our "ah-ha's" together -- what a pair.\
A dozen anunciations a day,\
A baker's dozen blessed moments,\ 
Sacred stillness,\
Our paired journey counts countless such\
As any would embrace.\
Thank you my dear Mary Patricia.
