## What we’re about

No Tai Chi experience is necessary. Learn with other beginners, and work your way up with the advance Tai Chi practitioners. We offer this meetup as a free community service. We teach Yang Style 24 Tai Chi Chuan, the most popular version practiced worldwide. Learn the foundation of Tai Chi with our [Certified Tai Chi Instructors](https://www.sohma.org/tai-chi/tai-chi-instructor-certification-course/) in a fun and supportive group. Learn at your own pace. For those who want to learn more quickly, we provide small learning groups for students at different levels, including Tai Chi cane, Tai Chi sword, and Tai Chi fan.

Want to take your Tai Chi to the next level? Take our online or hybrid [Tai Chi Certification Course](https://www.sohma.org/tai-chi/tai-chi-instructor-certification-course/). This program is great for those that simply want to accelerate their Tai Chi journey and/or become a certified instructor.
