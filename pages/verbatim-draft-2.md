# Verbatim draft 1
Paul is an 80 year old member of my church. He was raised Catholic and became an Episcopalian when he formed a marriage like relationship with a non-catholic. He became more active in the church when a centering prayer group started earlier this year. Both he and his wife were quite involved for several months. Paul had numerous conversations during these months that didn't involve me where he wondered what centering prayer was all about. He stopped attending a few weeks prior to our meeting.
I had prepared the SDI guidelines for Spiritual Direction, because I had thought that he might associate our time together with his experiences with a more traditional catholic approach that was prescriptive it is practices and values.
PH: As we began the session I waited for him to begin.
I have worked very hard at centering prayer. But I've decided that I can't continue. Martha ( his partner) is getting a lot out of it.
DH: Tell me more.
I've read the book. You can share this with [he named my wife].
DH: The nature of spiritual direction is that everything that you share is confidential.
PH: It brings up things that I don't want to deal with. It started when my first wife died. We had just moved to Florida and we're excited about the new life that we were going to lead. Within 2 weeks she was diagnosed with cancer and within 2 months she was gone.
DH: [with body language I showed I was listening]
PH: I didn't know anyone in our community and I felt isolated. I reached out and met a woman. It seemed like we were good for each other and within a few months we got married. Fairly quickly I realized that it was a mistake.
[I sensed that he was looking to see if I would find fault. If I was still accepting him.] You were still grieving your wife’s death?
[Without answering, he went on.]
PH: I went into a deep depression. I was hospitalized for a time. They put me on medication that I am still on at a lower dosage. I see the psychiatrist in order to adjust the medication. And it seems to be generally in control.
Centering prayer is not like what I am used to. I pray everyday. And I was taught to say my prayers. I imagine scenes from the Bible and I think about them. But centering prayer brings up all of the black and dark images from before.
DH: It sounds like you have a positive way of praying. That you have a prayer practice that works for you. There are other methods of Prayer and it sounds like you have found something that works for you.
PH: [doesn’t really respond, but goes on]
I just can't afford to go to those dark places. I have a family history with heart problems. I've had open heart surgery and it seems to be okay now. But I figure I have maybe 10 more years, seeing as how I've already outlived my parents and grandparents.
DH: What do you want to get out of these next 10 years?
PH: Martha is good for me. We're good for each other. I think I would like the years to be peaceful.
DH: That sounds like a good goal to be working for.
Our time was over at that point. I handed him the SDI guidelines. I Told him that the norm would be to keep our sessions at 60 minutes once a month, adding that if there is a reason, the guidelines are flexible and we can adjust. I asked him if he would like to schedule for a month or so. He said that since we would see each other at church we could just arrange something that way.
