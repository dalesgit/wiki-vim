> I don't know about Bishop Mar Mari, maybe he is actually Nestorian, maybe not. He's certainly a freelancing person supposedly bearing the ordination of a Bishop without being part of his own canonical diocese or jurisdiction, so it is rather obviously not be wise to take his advice as law, but he also seems to say many useful things if you can separate the wheat from the chaff. https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1afipcc/beware_of_nestorian_tik_tok_bishopmar_mari/

and ever amen please be
seated well very good evening to everyone how are we that's the way somebody yell out good
very good let's make it louder next time excellent um we thank the Lord Jesus
always for allowing us to be in his holy presence and sharing his word which is
the truth and the lifegiving word of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ The Holy
Bible the holy gospel the good news and today we are going back to our
commentary on the Book of Revelation and this evening we'll be reading from chapter 12 : 10-2 inclusive so it is
revelation 12 and vers 10 to 12
inclusive here we go then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now salvation and
strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ have come for
the accuser of our Brethren who accuse them before our God day and night has
been cast down and they overcame him by the blood
of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they did not love their
lives to the death therefore Rejoice O heavens and you who dwell in them woe to
the inhabitants of the earth and the Sea for the devil has come down to you
having great wrath because he knows that he has a short time and all glory be to
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ forever and ever
amen well um it's an interesting topic this evening as the Holy Bible is always
interesting there is no section in the Holy Bible no part that is not interesting since it is the word of God
then it has to be interesting just a recap on what we have been talking
about thus far The Book of Revelation we can split it
into two or even three sections chapter one we can put it on
its own as an introduction to the entire Book of Revelation which is made out of
22 chapters so chapter one is an intro chapter 2 and three talks about the
history of the church I think maybe the Reverb put it down slightly down farther
chapter 2 and three talks about the history of the church and chapter 4 onwards talks about
the future and what will happen to the world to the human
race in total so chapter 1 introduction chapter 2 and three the history of the
church chapter 4 to 22 talks about the future of the world and what will happen
to those who live in darkness and choose to continue living in darkness that is
why when we read from chapter 4 onwards you'll see uh start talking about the
seals the trumpets and the balls and we said they are Seven Seals seven trumpets
and seven balls the the the seal the trumpet and the ball are all talking
about one thing however the seal is talking about the promises of Jesus
Christ to those who love him to to those who choose him as Lord and Savior the
promises example I am with you all the days of your life and until the end of
all ages that is a promise I will leave you I will not leave you
orphans I will come to you I am the Good Shepherd who leads his his flock to
Green Pastures and still water these promises Jesus Christ always
fulfills therefore if you believe in him if you trust in him and if you have made
him your lord your God your everything then fear no one fear nothing for
God delivers every promise he makes first the
promises then when the Lord sees people are not giving heed to those promises
he'll send warnings trumpets are the warnings when the trumpet blows it's an
Awakening call meaning something massive is going to come after the warning so
the warning is based on love out of love God Jesus Christ who is God sends the
warning to make us alert and bring our attention once more back to him because
what happened the world has drifted us all away from him the pleasures and the
Treasures of the world and the busyness of the world we drifted away without realizing that we have gone very far
away then he will blow the trumpet after the trumpets the balls will come filled
with fire meaning judgment because after God's warnings then if you listen to
that warning go good for you if you don't then his judgment is coming and no
one can ever stop God's Wrath when the time
comes so far we are dealing with trumpet number
seven it's the last trumpet now the last trumpet that we are in deep trouble if
we don't wake up so what has been happening in the
world is nothing short of God's warning to those who confess and profess Jesus
Christ as Lord and Savior see the world rejected him from the start they are not
interested in God and we can see that all around us people are not interested
in God anymore and they are denying his very existence but the Lord is sending
his warnings for those who supposes ly call themselves
Christians he's warning us out of love be alert be awake and read the signs of
the end of times because after the warnings are over my wrath will come
upon everyone who decided to remain asleep along the
way so we are in the last trumpet the seventh
and the seventh trumpet began towards the end of chapter 11 and we are now in chapter
12 since it's been um four or five weeks by having a break for the festive season
and by the way merry Christmas and happy New Year to all of you my beloved so
it's a refresher refresher what we have done so far so trumpet number seven the
last one is towards the end of chapter 11 we see the beginning of chapter 12
talking about two signs in heaven one a
woman she is engulfed with the sun and the moon under her feet and there is a
crown on her head with 12 stars on it and this woman is about to give birth
and she gave birth with pain we spoke about this woman being the Israelite
Nation the Israelite nation is this woman engulfed in the with the sun and
the moon under her feet and a and and a crown on her head with 12 stars on it
and this woman is Israelite the Israelite nation that gave birth to Jesus Christ of Nazareth the sun his
divinity the moon his humanity and the crown on her head with 12 Stars the 12
Stars being the 12 apostles whom he had chosen from the Israelite
nation and we said it can also relate at a smaller
scale our holy mother Mary it could relate to the holy mother
as well at a smaller scale however when you read the entire text you will see it
is talking about the Israelite Nation more than the holy
mother because this woman fled to the
Wilderness the holy mother did not flee to the Wilderness
so and there was another sign this dragon with seven heads and 10
horns and this Dragon was about he was getting ready for this woman for once
giving birth to her child he was about to devour that
child he was about to devour that child once she gave birth to
him the child was born this woman the Israelite Nation
gave birth to this child and this woman went into the
Wilderness um 70 AD where the Roman army
[Music] came and
demolished and wiped Jerusalem and the temple with it and the Israelite Nation
got scattered all over the world until
[Music] 1948 what a huge gap from 70 AD they
never went back to their Homeland until 9 1948 they were living in
Exile and then this child was taken up to heaven by God well he ascended and
sat at the right hand of the father and when that happened this
dragon that is being mentioned in the beginning of chapter 12 is the old
serpent which is Satan himself now pay attention please Satan
Satan will have four FS will have four FS before he is wiped
once and for all the first fall happened in the heaven of all
Heavens at the beginning God created him as an angel of God and this Angel held
the highest rank in the Angelic orders being the cherubims or or the
Cherub so he was one of the cherubims the highest Angelic Order full of
knowledge beautiful there is no tomorrow for his
Beauty when he chose to establish his own government in
heaven and be like God the ruling power in heaven God kicked him out of the
heaven of all heaven and brought him into the
heavens so from the heaven of all Heavens he was kicked out into the
heavens and to prove this when we read in the Book of Job it talks about the God Gathering his
angels around him and then Satan coming and standing in the midst of them
all so was still allowed to enter Heavens but he was kicked out from the
heaven of all Heavens now this Heaven of all Heavens is where Jesus Christ Our
Lord and Savior has been sitting there for the past 2,000 and OD years he
ascended to heaven and sat at the right hand of the Father the right hand of the
father is the heaven of all Heavens this Angel who is now Satan used to live in
the heaven of all Heavens meaning in the presence of the almighty God face to
face he got kicked out but he was still allowed to go into the heavens and come
and join the Assembly of God with his angels what was he doing then this Satan
this Dragon this old serpent he was
sending his accusations to God against us cuz now we read in that's what I want
to get to the accuser he is called the accuser he is brilliant as being the
accuser he is a master of accusations or making up accusations he is a master
over it all so he used to go to God enter the heavens and complain against
me against you against everyone saying to God look is this what you call a son
is this what you call your own child look how they acting look how they behaving look they are sinning look what
they're doing look what they're saying look how they are living until when
punish them God he used to send those accusations to
God against us when Jesus Christ was crucified who went against the Lord say
be the dragon and he brought people to go against him and crucify him but Jesus
crushed the head of this Dragon the old serpent on Calvary on the
cross you see this Dragon old serpent you see him appearing at two places very
vividly one at the former Adam once at the former Adam and second at the latter
Adam Jesus Christ when the former Adam was created by God and placed in the
Garden of Eden who appeared in the Garden of Eden the snake you see this Fallen Angel the
Cherub this Fallen Angel entered the snake in order to whisper in our mother
Eve's ear and make her ve of the path to fall and make Adam fall with him so so
who caused the fall of Adam and Eve the snake who is the snake the dragon who is
the dragon Satan Satan appeared the moment Adam the former Adam appeared and
again we see in chapter 12 Satan reappearing as the dragon as the old
serpent the moment the latter Adam is about to be given birth to by the women
the Israelite nation and that child is Jesus Christ who is the letter
Adam the snake appears again to devour him but this time to his shock the
latter Adam crushed his
head when you read in Genesis 3:15 there's a prophecy about the seed
of the woman now Jesus Christ is the only
person that came into this world having a an Earthly mother only no earthly
father he is the only human being that has an Earthly mother no earthly father
every single human being that came to this world was born of Adam and Eve
definitely not Adam and
Steve so we need to stop this
nonsense my goodness what a sick world what a sick
world the only human this has got nothing to do with Christianity I'm talking about
Humanity the only human who has Earthly mother only is Jesus Christ in this he
stands alone so unique to every other human being in this alone we need to
search and find out who is this human that only has an Earthly mother how did
he come to this world without Earthly mother only humanly it's impossible
therefore there has to be something hidden much bigger than this it can only
be a divine intervention if if it's humanly impossible then it
is divinely possible so this seed of the woman
applies to Jesus Christ Genesis 3:15 only applies to Jesus Christ of Nazareth
no one else because he is the only one that is born of a woman with no earthly
father for his father is the one who art in heaven
so this latter Adam was born Satan the dragon the old serpent thought just like
he overcame the former Adam in the Garden of Eden it's easy I'm going to
devour this one he is another Adam another human being what's the big deal
about this one not knowing he was being crushed on Calvary on the cross by the
seed of the wom the latter Adam Jesus Christ of Nazareth all glory to His holy
name and with a huge amen
amen
now I was going to say something is the holy spirit will remind me I get excited when I talk about the
Lord
Jesus Christ the letter Adam was born the seed of the woman see the Holy
Spirit reminded me Genesis 3:15 also continues and says
that God is talking to the snake to the dragon to Satan God is talking to him he
said I God I will put enmity there's going to be a lot of tension I I will
put enmity between you and the woman the woman being mother Mary I will put
enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed now her
seed will come and crush your head and you will bruise his
heel her seed will crush your head Satan
and you will bruise the heel of the seed of of the woman Jesus
Christ now let me elaborate on this I don't think we'll be talking about our topic this
evening when you read the Holy Bible you need to understand the language of the
Holy Bible the seed of the woman will crush
the head of the serpent the seed Jesus Christ will crush the head of the
serpent so there is the head and there is the heel we all understand when we
look at a human body the head is the highest level and the heel is the lowest
level in the human body correct okay
so what is the highest level in this human the spirit what is the lowest
level in this human the body when you read in 1 Thessalonians
5:23 St Paul Paul says every human has Body Soul and Spirit the two main
components of the human is the spirit and the body what ties the two together
is the soul so the soul ties the two together why because spirit is light
body is Darkness spirit is Heavenly Body
is materialistic two different Realms cannot live together together cannot
connect to one another it's like Apple Macintosh and XP hard drives can't
communicate cannot read one another two different programs so the spirit comes from a spiritual realm and the body
comes from a tangible materialistic realm one is Light Spirit the other is
Darkness body can there be a connection and a bond between light and darkness
impossible it is either light day or it is either Darkness night the two
together at the same time cannot happen so what God did he brought the Spirit
light and wanted to join it to the body Darkness he said what is impossible to
man is possible to me God I will create something else called the s o u l soul
and through the soul I'll connect the impossible light and darkness live
together in Harmony so he created the soul to connect but the two main components is
the spirit and the body the spirit is the head the body is the
heel when you run a marathon they give you prices bronze
silver gold bronze when you come third when you come second they give you
silver when you come first they give you gold gold is your spirit the head bronze
is your body the heel silver is your soul that connects between the gold
spirit and bronze
body the seed of the woman will crush your head
Serpent and you in turn you will bruise his heel what did Satan do to Jesus
Christ he bruised him on the cross he shaded the body the heel on the cross
but what did Jesus do to the serpent he crushed the head of the serpent why the
head because since Satan is spirit and has no other components but Spirit
therefore spirit is the head so Jesus Christ has to has to crush the head he
is Spirit but Satan bruised the
body Satan bruised the body Jesus was crushed on the cross his body
was shredded to Pieces but the Lord crushed the head of
Satan himself is it
hot maybe half a degree when it's hot it's normally my presence I'm
just just naturally hot hot hot so now
a snake if you want to kill a
snake if you cut the snake's body in half the body will regrow again it will
not die the only time you will kill a snake When you crush the head of the snake the moment you crush the head that
it it's dead it's gone once and for all and the poison of the snake comes
through the head when you crush the head of the snake you can grabb it from its
tail once the head is gone you can grab the snake from its tail because you are not afraid that the snake will turn
around and bite you but if the snake is intact if the head of the snake is intact and you hold the snake from the
tail your dead meat you need to grab it from its head otherwise it will turn around and bite
you before you blink your eyes the Lord Jesus crushed the head of
the snake Satan meaning that poison that used to kill
mankind which the Lord said about Satan he is the killer of mankind from the
very beginning he poisoned Adam and Eve and made them fall into sin and the
wages of sin is death he killed the human race Jesus Christ came through his
Precious Blood became the antidote to this poison crush the head of the snake
to make sure that poison is no longer released to kill those who claim and
confess and profess Jesus Christ to be their lord and savior Satan can't poison
you anymore because the blood of the Lamb of God became the antidote to the
poison of the snake now to those who are Christians true Christians not by name
but by deed to those who are true Christians the Lord said you can step on
the snake and you can drink the poison of the snake and nothing will harm you why because I jesus crushed the head of
the serpent now you can grab the snake and play with
it but the day you walk away from me Satan will play with
you now
when the Lord crushed the head of the serpent and went up to heaven and sat at
the right hand of the father this Fallen Angel has no place in
the heaven of all Heavens because there is one human being like
us overcame Satan he has no excuse to go to God and accuse us of anything if he
enters Heaven he's going to see Jesus the man this man Satan tried everything under the sun to
make him fall with no Prevail so now Satan has no
place to enter Heaven and say to God this human being broke your law Jesus
will say God this Satan is lying because I didn't and I crushed him and I overcame
him on Calvary so you have no place here since this man entered heaven and took
your place which you were there once upon a time from the very beginning the heaven of all
Heavens he got kicked out of there into the heavens when Jesus went up he opened
the gates of paradise when he opened the Gate of paradise Satan got kicked out of the
heavens into the air a i r
he is the ruler of the air he came into the air so from the
heaven of all Heavens to the heavens from the Heavens to the air and then now
until this day he is still the ruler of the air now what does the Holy Bible mean by he is the ruler of the a air
here represents
thoughts so what does Satan have authority over he can manipulate your
thoughts can he bash you up physically no why because the Lord has not given
him this Authority yet has not given him this jurisdiction yet but a time is
coming very near where he will start bashing us
literally but until now what is he what does he have as jurisdiction to end
enter our thoughts and play with them now can I ask you this and be
honest isn't that the case my beloveds what is Satan doing with
people's thought thinking he is playing soccer with
it he will come into this person's head and that person's head and make him go
against one another and by the way his timing is so sometimes is so
perfect oh he times it so well you're sitting at home and he he puts this
thought in your head about someone that someone is not with you you start Che going after this thought and
this thought starts building starts growing starts shaping up and you start
painting it you become Michelangelo you become an artist in coming up with ideas
and assumptions by the time Satan is done with you that person the moment I
see them I will bury them and not only that he will do it in
a way he'll put some thought in that guy's head as well now he'll bring you
to this particular place and he'll bring the other person to this particular place but he will blind that other
person by passing you without saying hello to you now this to you is a stamp
sealed on you with this person hates me you see they didn't say hello to me
that's it I will never talk to them I will never call them I will never go to
their home they are dead to me
finished Satan is playing with your head sorry this is the
truth Satan is playing with your head God Jesus Christ is love he will never
put a negative thought in your head so when a negative thought comes rurus the
main source is Satan 99% is Satan 1% is
you because you're weak you give in to Satan's
playlist can we play this music Satan yeah please do press this button
This song is called I hate you this song is
called I'll catch I'll catch you this thought this song
says I'll bury you guys you becoming very uh Geniuses
well done keep them coming Satan has the jurisdiction being
the ruler of the air to play with people's thoughts because the air my beloved metaphorically talks about the
way you think because the way we think is like the air blows this way blows that way blows everywhere and with our
thinking we are everywhere I'm sitting in the church attending the Holy Mass service I'm thinking about Bondi
Beach I'm I'm I'm in the church but I see myself in the club
or I just remembered I forgot to say happy
birthday to so and so and half of the mass I had no idea
what it was all about because I was thinking about their birthday or about burying
them the next time Satan will Fall Again
from the air and onto the Earth we saw that in chapter 12 before verse 10 that
there was a a great battle between the Archangel Michael and this dragon and
the Archangel Michael along with his with those angels who sided with him
fought against Satan the dragon and by the way the dragon Satan pulled oneir of
the the stars with his tail he pulled them down with him so onethird of the entire
angels of heaven one-third of them have been fooled by this Fallen Angel called
Satan he fooled them he deceived them and he pulled them along with him so he
has onethird God has 2/3 of the Angels still with him in heaven and those two3
are all with us so we have here now Satan crushed by
Jesus Christ of Nazareth our Lord and savior he got only the tail he's playing
with people's heads with his tail the head is crushed now he has one-third of
the Angels which became foul Spirits working for
him but we have Jesus Christ God crushed Satan through his Humanity
on Calvary and we also have 23 of the Angelic orders with us supporting
us when you have God on your side you don't need no one else but it's an extra
bonus you have angels as well and now you have saints as well in heaven also
praying for you and one of the the ultimate saint of
all is this sweetheart mother Mary the ultimate Saint the mother of All Saints
the mother of All
Saints Satan wanted to establish a government in
heaven he wanted to be like God God is The Sovereign Authority God is the king
God is the ruler God has a government and he runs rules this government he is
the head of this government in heaven Satan while he was this Angel cherub
wanted to be like God he said I will establish my own government system and
I'll be the head of the system in heaven where God is he is God I am going to be
another God God said to an to this Angel the only time you can claim to be
God is when you are the uncreated being and you are the creator of everyone and
everything therefore I am the only Sovereign God because I am the only
uncreated being and I am the creator of you and everything else therefore in
this Heaven There is one place only for the True Divine God you are now a false
god I'm going to kick you out of this heaven when he fell from that heaven and
became the prince of this air of the Wind he came with that same idea of
establishing a governmental system this time on
Earth he said I failed in heaven I'll make sure I don't fail on
Earth I'm still going to be the rule
