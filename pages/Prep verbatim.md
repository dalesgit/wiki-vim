### [[Guenther-notes]]

- **listen to the stories** Letting my SDee tell their story
- when have I acted the **amateur**
- Marcus came burdened: job search at mature age, but he's secure in his faith (Blocked?)
- being priest/teacher together: egs. with Marcus where he wanted to know â€¦ [*volunteering too much?*]
- Non-anxious presence
- avoid spiritualizing. asking about the body.
- I am good at asking questions, often get too involved in giving my own story
