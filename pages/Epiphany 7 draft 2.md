I wonder what the right reaction is to having heard the words that we have just read from scripture?

We might just reflect that all those passages are familiar. I’ve heard those before. It would be entirely appropriate to have some questions. A few years ago, the dean of Harvard graduate school of education, began speaking and writing about questions that really matter. Wait, what I wonder?? How can I help what truly matters?

Over 100 years ago GK Chesterton Road, the Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting it has been found difficult and left on tried.

Like much of what we read in the Bible, as well as in the tradition, I think the best response we can make to them is to ask questions. Some of you have heard me tell the story about a young Jewish student living in a remote village centuries ago, shouting at the top of his lungs as he ran down the muddy street in his village, I’ve got the answer. I’ve got the answer quick somebody tell me the question

What do we pay attention to? What do we let flow in one ear and out the other and what do we stop and ask wait what? What truly matters? Who and what do we take as authority? Who do we listen to? Who points us in the direction we follow in our life?

I looked it up, comma I googled it, so it must be true. I read that the middle class spends about 33% of our income on housing, about 17% on transportation, 13% on food and 13% on insurance and pensions. The left over is Crazy money I guess.

I thought about it a bit, and I thought those percentages don’t apply to the poor people that I have known. They don’t have much of the way of money. They have a lot of time-– actually the same amount of time you and I have. But they spend energy Getting food and drink to survive the day. They typically wouldn’t have to pay money for shelter, but they might well have to be in genius.
On the other hand, as you may well be aware, wealth has changed hands over the last several generations.

From the pew research, I read that 

> The growth and income in recent decades has tilted to upper income households. At the same time, the US middle class, which once comprise, the clear majority of Americans, is shrinking. Thus, a greater share of the nations aggregate income is now going to upper income households and the share going to middle and lower income households is fallen

those of you who are still with me, I want to say to you that I think Jesus cares about those kinds of things.
GK Chesterton said to love means, loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Face means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.

Wait, what?

Who is our authority? Where do we get the information on which we base the course of our lives? Where do we spend our money?

last we get bogged down, I remember that GK Chesterton said angels can fly because they can take themselves lightly. I tell myself that regularly when I’m taking myself too seriously. I actually believe that Jesus did the same thing.
When I was just sorting out how to be serious about my Christian faith, my priest took me on 1000 mile trip to spend a long weekend listening to Archbishop Michael Ramsey give a talk at the Nashotah house on authority in the gospels of the New Testament. I was smitten by what he had to say about authority, in the Greek exousia, enough so that I later went to the Nashotah house for seminary and my life has never been the same since.

Who are the authorities that we listen to? That changes our lives?
