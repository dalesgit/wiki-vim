I wonder what the right reaction is to having heard the words that we have just read from scripture?

We might just reflect that all those passages are familiar. I’ve heard those before. It would be entirely appropriate to have some questions. A few years ago, the dean of Harvard graduate school of education, began speaking and writing about questions that really matter. Wait, what I wonder?? How can I help what truly matters?

Over 100 years ago GK Chesterton Road, the Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting it has been found difficult and left on tried.

Like much of what we read in the Bible, as well as in the tradition, I think the best response we can make to them is to ask questions. Some of you have heard me tell the story about a young Jewish student living in a remote village centuries ago, shouting at the top of his lungs as he ran down the muddy street in his village, I’ve got the answer. I’ve got the answer quick somebody tell me the question

What do we pay attention to? What do we let flow in one ear and out the other and what do we stop and ask wait what? What truly matters? Who and what do we take as authority? Who do we listen to? Who points us in the direction we follow in our life?

I looked it up, I googled it, -- so it must be true. I read that the middle class spends about 33% of our income on housing, about 17% on transportation, 13% on food and 13% on insurance and pensions. The left over is Crazy money I guess.

I thought about it a bit, and I thought those percentages don’t apply to the poor people that I have known. They don’t have much of the way of money. They have a lot of time-– actually the same amount of time you and I have. But they spend energy Getting food and drink to survive the day. They typically wouldn’t have to pay money for shelter, but they might well have to be in genius.
On the other hand, as you may well be aware, wealth has changed hands over the last several generations.

From the pew research, I read that 

> The growth and income in recent decades has tilted to upper income households. At the same time, the US middle class, which once comprise, the clear majority of Americans, is shrinking. Thus, a greater share of the nations aggregate income is now going to upper income households and the share going to middle and lower income households is fallen

those of you who are still with me, I want to say to you that I think Jesus cares about those kinds of things.
GK Chesterton said to love means, loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Face means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.

Wait, what?

Who is our authority? Where do we get the information on which we base the course of our lives? Where do we spend our money?

last we get bogged down, I remember that GK Chesterton said angels can fly because they can take themselves lightly. I tell myself that regularly when I’m taking myself too seriously. I actually believe that Jesus did the same thing.
When I was just sorting out how to be serious about my Christian faith, my priest took me on 1000 mile trip to spend a long weekend listening to Archbishop Michael Ramsey give a talk at the Nashotah house on authority in the gospels of the New Testament. I was smitten by what he had to say about authority, in the Greek exousia, enough so that I later went to the Nashotah house for seminary and my life has never been the same since.

The Greek word used for "authority" --  *exousia* -- has to do with what rightly comes out of the **being** before us. An illustration: an acorn as the exousia, the authority, to become an oak tree. The word means both that kind of authority and the kind of authority that exercises power.

> During the civil wars in feudal Japan, an invading army would quickly sweep into a town and take control. In one particular village, everyone fled just before the army arrived - everyone except the Zen monk. Curious about this old fellow, the general went to the temple to see for himself what kind of man this monk was. When he wasn't treated with the deference and submissiveness to which he was accustomed, the general burst into anger. "You fool," he shouted as he reached for his sword, "don't you realize you are standing before a man who could run you through without blinking an eye!" But despite the threat, the master seemed unmoved. "And do you realize," the master replied calmly, "that you are standing before a man who can let you run me through without blinking an eye?"

This is an old Japanese Zen story. https://www.reddit.com/r/ramdass/comments/qrn0tz/im_trying_to_remember_a_story_about_a_monk_and_a/

Who are the authorities that we listen to? That changes our lives? Chesterton said, **“The word "good" has many meanings. For example, if a man were to shoot his grandmother at a range of five hundred yards, I should call him a good shot, but not necessarily a good man.”**

For many of us the political landscape is burning within us. But in an effort to not take ourselves too seriously, Chesterton said about that, 

**“The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types -- the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution.”**

Who is the we and who is the them? That's an important question. Jesus had something to say about that. 

> I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. Do to others as you would have them do to you.

Wait? What?

It’s so easy to hear what we’ve always heard and not hear that the lesson may be something else. 

Chesterton said there’s a lot of difference between listening and hearing.

That happened to me with regard to the first reading today from scripture. Always before I heard that as a lesson of a family finally being reunited. There’s all the drama that went before BROTHERS against BROTHERS and dreams that got you into jail and out of jail . The reversal of destiny’s.

But what I realized just this past couple of weeks it’s really an old testament version of what we call a Good Samaritan in the New Testament. Joseph by the time the passage we heard comes about is fully Egyptian. He is a stranger, a foreigner. Egyptians and Canaanites did not get along. But as we heard today, Joseph recognizes family in these beggars from a foreign land.

Jesus said, "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same."

Asking the right questions will tell us what is worth while and what is not. We will discover our true authority if we ask the right questions.
