# Human perspective

## Sapiens **Harari**: 2025. 

From renowned historian Yuval Noah Harari comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

> **DH**: This is a huge book – fitting the subject matter I suppose. I think I want to attempt to read it myself.

## Ideas: A History of Thought from Fire to Freud **Watson**: 2005. 
In this hugely ambitious and exciting book Peter Watson tells the history of ideas from prehistory to the present day, seeking a new way to tell the history of the world. The book begins over a million years ago with a discussion of how the earliest ideas might have originated. Looking at animal behaviour that appears to require some thought  tool-making, territoriality, counting, language (or at least sounds), pairbonding  Peter Watson moves on to the apeman and the development of simple ideas such as cooking, the earliest language, the emergence of family life. All the obvious areas will be tackled  the Ancient Greeks, Christian theology, the ideas of Jesus, astrological thought, the soul, the self, beliefs about the heavens, the ideas of Islam, the Crusades, humanism, the Renaissance, Gutenberg and the book, the scientific revolution, the age of discovery, Shakespeare, the idea of Revolution, the Romantic imagination, Darwin, imperialism, modernism, Freud right up to the present day and the internet.

IDEAS: A HISTORY will concentrate on the activities and achievements of philosophers, writers, artists, scientists, inventors, religious thinkers, poets, historians, jurists and dramatists, investigating how their ideas have shaped our lives and thinking

> **DH**: So many of these books are huge! I would love to look into this. I don't know if I have it in me.
# Western thought

## *The Cave and the Light* **Hernan**: 2013. 

Arthur Herman has now written the definitive sequel to his New York Times bestseller, How the Scots Invented the Modern World, and extends the themes of the book—which sold half a million copies worldwide—back to the ancient Greeks and forward to the age of the Internet. The Cave and the Light is a magisterial account of how the two greatest thinkers of the ancient world, Plato and Aristotle, laid the foundations of Western culture—and how their rivalry shaped the essential features of our culture down to the present day.

> **DH**: This looks like a fun book to read quickly. It was about the 2 paths of Plato and Aristotle that already in my youth I accepted the notion that the world is made up of two kinds of people: platonic or aristotelian. I later adopted the variation: the world is made up of 2 kinds of people, those who divide the world into 2 kinds of people and those who don't.

## _Greek Realities_ **Hooper**: 1978. 

"The study of the Greeks can never be a closed account. The wide variety of critical and descriptive works written about them . . . . bears witness to man's continuing preoccupation with himself. Other ages might talk of God or machines; the Greeks, from Homer to Diogenes, were fascinated with man. Plato's emphasis on the spiritual world and Diogenes' unheroic retreat may seem to be departures from the Greek way. But that would be true if there were a single Greek way. Obviously, there was not. It is the variety of ideas about man, who he is and who he hopes to be, which is the real Greek legacy . . . . This book \[begins] with the rich tombs of Mycenaean kings who tried desperately to preserve what they had won. It ends with Diogenes and his fellow Cynics who say that it is better to let it all go. In between are the heroes, the art, the history which belong to the ancient Greeks. The questions they raised and the answers they offered are still the concern of us all."

> **DH**: I don't know this work. At 480 pp. it is probably a dense read. One would gather a lot of information about the Greek origins. No doubt some (or more than some?) is outdated by recent archaeological and historical work.

 
## _Civilisation_ **Clark**: 2015.

> **DH**: Originally a 1969 British television series. At the moment it is available on _Youtube_. The book is available in a kindle edition for $3.99. For a long time the book seemed to be on every coffee table of folks I knew. "Clark himself worried that his 'risky' generalizations, which worked well on television, would come across, in print, as ill-founded, irritating and trite." (From the introduction by Alastair Cooke.) I don't think this is **trite**, but a useful way to get a broad perspective on our history – however we might conceive that. I wish today's generation was exposed to this "broad perspective."

## _The Proper Study of Mankind_ **Berlin** 2000. 

Isaiah Berlin was one of the leading thinkers of our time and one of its finest writers. The Proper Study of Mankind brings together his most celebrated writing: here the reader will find Berlin's famous essay on Tolstoy, "The Hedgehog and the Fox"; his penetrating portraits of contemporaries from Pasternak and Akhmatova to Churchill and Roosevelt; his essays on liberty and his exposition of pluralism; his defense of philosophy and history against assimilation to scientific method; and his brilliant studies of such intellectual originals as Machiavelli, Vico, and Herder.


> **DH**: Another classic author. This is an anthology. I'm sure this would be interesting reading. Would it contain what you're looking for right now.

## _History of Knowledge_ **Van Doren**: 1992.

> **DH**: This the kind of collection that I have gobbled up in my time, although I haven't read this. A gigantic overview that is bound to be quirky, fun to skim, and perhaps showing its bias (whatever that is).

## _The Story of Philosophy_ **Durant** .

"The Story of Philosophy" is a captivating intellectual journey that explores the evolution of human thought and the enduring legacy of great thinkers throughout history. Written by the renowned author Will Durant, this monumental work provides readers with a comprehensive overview of the world's philosophical traditions, from ancient Greece to the modern era.

Through 11 volumes, each dedicated to a specific philosopher or philosophical era, Durant delves into the intricacies of thought, revealing the profound impact of philosophy on human civilization. From Plato's idealism to Aristotle's empirical inquiry and Francis Bacon's scientific revolution, this series offers a deep dive into the intellectual tapestry of human history.

"The Story of Philosophy" is a timeless exploration of the quest for knowledge and wisdom, making it essential reading for anyone curious about the foundations of human thought."

> **DH**: I have read from this massive work off and on throughout my adult life. Even when I was young I recognized it as a **survey** will all the limitations of that. But it was useful for getting the big picture.
 
## From Dawn to Decadence **Barzun**: 2001 (orig).
Highly regarded here and abroad for some thirty works of cultural history and criticism, master historian Jacques Barzun has set down in one continuous narrative the sum of his discoveries and conclusions about the whole of Western culture since 1500. Barzun describes what Western Man wrought from the Renaissance and Reformation down to the present in the double light of its own time and our pressing concerns. 

> **DH**:I haven't read this. I should have. If your focus is on the modern world from a traditional perspective of the developed world, this is probably the basic building block.

## Classics of Western Philosophy **Cahn**: 8th ed. 
The Eighth Edition of Steven M. Cahn's Classics of Western Philosophy offers the same exacting standard of editing and translation that made earlier editions of this anthology the most highly valued and widely used volume of its kind. But the Eighth Edition offers exciting new content as well: Plato's Laches (complete), new selections from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (on courage), Descartes' Discourse on Method (complete), all previously omitted sections of Berkeley's A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, Kant's Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (complete).

> **DH**: This is a textbook version of classic texts. Not for bedtime reading. But it would provide a great way to see what are regarded as the classic voices in Western Philosophy. Pick an author.

## _Columbia History of Western Philosophy_ **Popkin**: 2000. 

Richard Popkin has assembled 63 leading scholars to forge a highly approachable chronological account of the development of Western philosophical traditions. From Plato to Wittgenstein and from Aquinas to Heidegger, this volume provides lively, in-depth, and up-to-date historical analysis of all the key figures, schools, and movements of Western philosophy. … Combining a broad scope and penetrating analysis with a keen sense of what is relevant for the modern reader, The Columbia History of Western Philosophy will prove an accessible introduction for students and an informative overview for general readers.

> **DH**: This is important I think because of the newer, broader perspective it brings compared to the classical European view. I suspect it is an important work. 



## Aquinas, Aristotle and the promise of the Common Good **Keys**
## The Closing of the Western Mind **Freeman**
## The Dream of Wisdom: History of Philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance **Gottlieb**
## God's Men; the origins of western culture **Parkes**: 1959.

> **DH**:  This is an obviously dated perspective, but it evidently seeks to dig deeper and broader than the Greek/Roman/European "Western Civ'" view of culture, including as it does India as a part of the "origins" of western culture.
## A History of Western Philosophy **Russell**


# Political theory
## An Invitation to Political Thought **Deutsch and Fornieri**
## History of Political Philosophy **Strauss and Cropsey**
## *Liberalism: Ancient and Modern* **Strauss**: 1995. 

Revered and reviled, Leo Strauss has left a rich legacy of work that continues to spark discussion and controversy. This volume of essays ranges over critical themes that define Strauss's thought: the tension between reason and revelation in the Western tradition, the philsophical roots of liberal democracy, and especially the conflicting yet complementary relationship between ancient and modern liberalism. For those seeking to become acquainted with this provocative thinker, one need look no further.

> **DH**: Strauss is one of the "must reads" in the area of 20th c. political theory. This would probably provide something of an introduction to his work.

## _Toward Democracy_ **Kloppenberg**: 2016. 

In this magnificent and encyclopedic overview, James T. Kloppenberg presents the history of democracy from the perspective of those who struggled to envision and achieve it. The story of democracy remains one without an ending, a dynamic of progress and regress that continues to our own day. In the classical age "democracy" was seen as the failure rather than the ideal of good governance. Democracies were deemed chaotic and bloody, indicative of rule by the rabble rather than by enlightened minds. Beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries, however, first in Europe and then in England's North American colonies, the reputation of democracy began to rise, resulting in changes that were sometimes revolutionary and dramatic, sometimes gradual and incremental.

> **DH**: This is gigantic in length and no doubt comprehensive in its survey of the shifting experience with "democracy". This wouldn't float to the top of my list because I already get the notion that our experience of "democracy" has evolved and will evolve, perhaps has ended. But I don't see that it would help me to discern my place in our current manifestation of "democracy". 

## Classic of Moral and Political Theory **Morgan, ed**

# American focused
## The New England Soul **Stout**: 2011.
"Both the sources he employs and the scope of his study set his work apart from all that have precede it...The first study of New England preaching to span the entire colonial period...very important book."
-- Journal of American History

"Simply breathtaking in scope. No one else has dared to grapple with the full sweep of Puritan preaching form the founding of New England through the American Revolution."
-- Nathan O. Hatch, University of Notre Dame

> **DH**: New England preaching might be regarded as the source of the American "soul". Special channel to God's will. Puritan. I'm sure this is a masterful work. Pretty specialized. 

## The Metaphysical Club **Menand**: 2002

The Metaphysical Club was an informal group that met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872, to talk about ideas. Its members included Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., future associate justice of the United States Supreme Court; William James, the father of modern American psychology; and Charles Sanders Peirce, logician, scientist, and the founder of semiotics. The Club was probably in existence for about nine months. No records were kept. The one thing we know that came out of it was an idea—an idea about ideas. This book is the story of that idea.

> **DH**: This is probably a good read. Cf. my notes on the transcendentalists below at **Gura**.
## Democracy in America **Tocqueville**.
Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-59) came to America in 1831 to see what a great republic was like. What struck him most was the country's equality of conditions, its democracy. The book he wrote on his return to France, Democracy in America, is both the best ever written on democracy and the best ever written on America. It remains the most often quoted book about the United States, not only because it has something to interest and please everyone, but also because it has something to teach everyone.
 
When it was published in 2000, Harvey Mansfield and Delba Winthrop's new translation of Democracy in America—only the third since the original two-volume work was published in 1835 and 1840—was lauded in all quarters as the finest and most definitive edition of Tocqueville's classic thus far.

> **DH**: How does one begin. This is required reading for understanding the American experiment. It is the first to identify basic contradictions at the heart of our national identity. Because it has been around for a long time, everyone you read about the subject will have processed de Tocqueville. I first tried grappling with his analysis through reading Robert Bellah's *Habits of the Heart*. I would heartily recommend that book, but like most of these texts they're not light reading.

## American Political Thought **Kramnick and Lowi**: 2009

Revised and updated based on instructor feedback, this Second Edition presents key works from the colonial period to the present era. New selections―including readings from the Obama and Trump eras―help students understand how political thought in the 21st century builds on and sometimes departs from earlier traditions. 

Kramnick was "a subject-matter expert on English and American political thought and history."

> **DH**: This is textbook with all the strengths and weaknesses that brings.

## Emerson: The Mind on Fire **Richardson**
## Beneath the American Renaissance **Reynolds**
## Theology in America **Holifield**
## America's God **Noll**
## Roger Williams and the Creation of the American Soul **Barry**
## Making of the American Self **Howe**
## The Idea of America **Wood**
## The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution **Bailyn**
## People of Paradox **Kammen**
## Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson: The Politics of Enlightenment and the American Founding **Staloff**
## *America the Philosophical* **Romano**: 2013. 

This bold, insightful book argues that America today towers as the most philosophical culture in the history of the world, an unprecedented marketplace for truth and debate.  With verve and keen intelligence, Carlin Romano—Pulitzer Prize finalist, award-winning book critic, and professor of philosophy—takes on the widely held belief that the United States is an anti-intellectual country. Instead he provides a richly reported overview of American thought, arguing that ordinary Americans see through phony philosophical justifications faster than anyone else, and that the best of our thinkers ditch artificial academic debates for fresh intellectual enterprises. Along the way, Romano seeks to topple philosophy’s most fiercely admired hero, Socrates, asserting that it is Isocrates, the nearly forgotten Greek philosopher who rejected certainty, whom Americans should honor as their intellectual ancestor. America the Philosophical is a rebellious tour de force that both celebrates our country’s unparalleled intellectual energy and promises to bury some of our most hidebound cultural clichés.

> **DH**: The general public consensus as well as my own judgment is that Romano's analysis is not accurate. But a contrarian view is always worth looking at and testing one's presuppositions.


## American Transcendentalism **Gura**: 2008.
American Transcendentalism is a comprehensive narrative history of America’s first group of public intellectuals, the men and women who defined American literature and indelibly marked American reform in the decades before and following the America Civil War. Philip F. Gura masterfully traces their intellectual genealogy to transatlantic religious and philosophical ideas, illustrating how these informed the fierce local theological debates that, so often first in Massachusetts and eventually throughout America, gave rise to practical, personal, and quixotic attempts to improve, even perfect the world. The transcendentalists would painfully bifurcate over what could be attained and how, one half epitomized by Ralph Waldo Emerson and stressing self-reliant individualism, the other by Orestes Brownson, George Ripley, and Theodore Parker, emphasizing commitment to the larger social good.

> **DH**: I was late in appreciating the importance of the Transcendentals to the contradictory nature of the American ethos. I may try to read this (Kindle is only $3) I'm not sure this is where you want to start in your study, but I think it's important.

# Christian perspective

## Origins of Christian Morality **Meeks**: 1993 (orig. pub.) 

By the time Christianity became a political and cultural force in the Roman Empire, it had come to embody a new moral vision. This wise and eloquent book describes the formative years―from the crucifixion of Jesus to the end of the second century of the common era―when Christian beliefs and practices shaped their unique moral order. ... Meeks finds that for these Christians, the formation of morals means the formation of community; Roman or Jewish thought.

> **DH**: Meeks is a must read for understanding early Christianity. He was a pioneer in introducing a sociological analysis to that study. I encountered him through his _The first Urban Christians_. This is a serious work, not a summary. 

## Aristotle's Children **Rubenstein**: 2004.

A true account of a turning point in medieval history that shaped the modern world, from “a superb storyteller” and the author of When Jesus Became God (Los Angeles Times). Europe was in the long slumber of the Middle Ages, the Roman Empire was in tatters, and the Greek language was all but forgotten—until a group of twelfth-century scholars rediscovered and translated the works of Aristotle.  
   
The philosopher’s ideas spread like wildfire across Europe, offering the scientific view that the natural world, including the soul of man, was a proper subject of study.

> **DH**: This is important because of the linkage he explores between the "Children of Abraham" Aristotle. Mixture of Theology and Philosophy. The classical twins from the middle ages.
