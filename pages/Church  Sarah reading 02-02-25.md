- *America the Philosophical* **Romano**: 2013. This bold, insightful book argues that America today towers as the most philosophical culture in the history of the world, an unprecedented marketplace for truth and debate.  With verve and keen intelligence, Carlin Romano—Pulitzer Prize finalist, award-winning book critic, and professor of philosophy—takes on the widely held belief that the United States is an anti-intellectual country. Instead he provides a richly reported overview of American thought, arguing that ordinary Americans see through phony philosophical justifications faster than anyone else, and that the best of our thinkers ditch artificial academic debates for fresh intellectual enterprises. Along the way, Romano seeks to topple philosophy’s most fiercely admired hero, Socrates, asserting that it is Isocrates, the nearly forgotten Greek philosopher who rejected certainty, whom Americans should honor as their intellectual ancestor. America the Philosophical is a rebellious tour de force that both celebrates our country’s unparalleled intellectual energy and promises to bury some of our most hidebound cultural clichés.

> **DH**: The general public consensus as well as my own judgment is that Romano's analysis is not accurate. But a contrarian view is always worth looking at and testing one's presuppositions.

- *The Cave and the Light* **Hernan**: 2013. Arthur Herman has now written the definitive sequel to his New York Times bestseller, How the Scots Invented the Modern World, and extends the themes of the book—which sold half a million copies worldwide—back to the ancient Greeks and forward to the age of the Internet. The Cave and the Light is a magisterial account of how the two greatest thinkers of the ancient world, Plato and Aristotle, laid the foundations of Western culture—and how their rivalry shaped the essential features of our culture down to the present day.

> **DH**: This looks like a fun book to read quickly. It was about the 2 paths of Plato and Aristotle that already in my youth I accepted the notion that the world is made up of two kinds of people: platonic or aristotelian. I later adopted the variation: the world is made up of 2 kinds of people, those who divide the world into 2 kinds of people and those who don't.

- *Liberalism: Ancient and Modern* **Strauss**: 1995: Revered and reviled, Leo Strauss has left a rich legacy of work that continues to spark discussion and controversy. This volume of essays ranges over critical themes that define Strauss's thought: the tension between reason and revelation in the Western tradition, the philsophical roots of liberal democracy, and especially the conflicting yet complementary relationship between ancient and modern liberalism. For those seeking to become acquainted with this provocative thinker, one need look no further.

> **DH**: Strauss is one of the "must reads" in the area of 20th c. political theory. This would probably provide something of an introduction to his work.

- _Greek Realities_ **Hooper**: 1978. "The study of the Greeks can never be a closed account. The wide variety of critical and descriptive works written about them . . . . bears witness to man's continuing preoccupation with himself. Other ages might talk of God or machines; the Greeks, from Homer to Diogenes, were fascinated with man. Plato's emphasis on the spiritual world and Diogenes' unheroic retreat may seem to be departures from the Greek way. But that would be true if there were a single Greek way. Obviously, there was not. It is the variety of ideas about man, who he is and who he hopes to be, which is the real Greek legacy . . . . This book \[begins] with the rich tombs of Mycenaean kings who tried desperately to preserve what they had won. It ends with Diogenes and his fellow Cynics who say that it is better to let it all go. In between are the heroes, the art, the history which belong to the ancient Greeks. The questions they raised and the answers they offered are still the concern of us all."

> **DH**: I don't know this work. At 480 pp. it is probably a dense read. One would gather a lot of information about the Greek origins. No doubt some (or more than some?) is outdated by recent archaeological and historical work.

- _Sapiens_ **Harari**: 2025. From renowned historian Yuval Noah Harari comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?

> **DH**: This is a huge book – fitting the subject matter I suppose. I think I want to attempt to read it myself.
  
- _Toward Democracy_ **Kloppenberg**: 2016. In this magnificent and encyclopedic overview, James T. Kloppenberg presents the history of democracy from the perspective of those who struggled to envision and achieve it. The story of democracy remains one without an ending, a dynamic of progress and regress that continues to our own day. In the classical age "democracy" was seen as the failure rather than the ideal of good governance. Democracies were deemed chaotic and bloody, indicative of rule by the rabble rather than by enlightened minds. Beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries, however, first in Europe and then in England's North American colonies, the reputation of democracy began to rise, resulting in changes that were sometimes revolutionary and dramatic, sometimes gradual and incremental.

> **DH**: This is gigantic in length and no doubt comprehensive in its survey of the shifting experience with "democracy". This wouldn't float to the top of my list because I already get the notion that our experience of "democracy" has evolved and will evolve, perhaps has ended. But I don't see that it would help me to discern my place in our current manifestation of "democracy". 

- _Civilisation_ **Clark**: 2015.

> **DH**: Originally a 1969 British television series. At the moment it is available on _Youtube_. The book is available in a kindle edition for $3.99. For a long time the book seemed to be on every coffee table of folks I knew. "Clark himself worried that his 'risky' generalizations, which worked well on television, would come across, in print, as ill-founded, irritating and trite." (From the introduction by Alastair Cooke.) I don't think this is **trite**, but a useful way to get a broad perspective on our history – however we might conceive that. I wish today's generation was exposed to this "broad perspective."

- Origins of Christian Morality **Meeks**: 1993 (orig. pub.) By the time Christianity became a political and cultural force in the Roman Empire, it had come to embody a new moral vision. This wise and eloquent book describes the formative years―from the crucifixion of Jesus to the end of the second century of the common era―when Christian beliefs and practices shaped their unique moral order. ... Meeks finds that for these Christians, the formation of morals means the formation of community; Roman or Jewish thought.

> **DH**: Meeks is a must read for understanding early Christianity. He was a pioneer in introducing a sociological analysis to that study. I encountered him through his _The first Urban Christians_. This is a serious work, not a summary.
