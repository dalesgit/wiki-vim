I unpacked with Karen Billings at coffee hour about how I felt I was an elder. It started last night when I said to Peter in front of the congregation that it had been 42 years.

I told Karen about the young man I was angry about at McDonald's for his disrespect of the line of elderly Hawai'ians. I probably learned about that after my move to Hawai'i.
