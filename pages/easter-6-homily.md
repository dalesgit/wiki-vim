# Opening

## We've been gone

We've been away. I know some of you noticed -- thank you. Others of you no doubt saw my facial hair and didn't recognize me. I forgive you. Of all my siblings and children, I'm the only one who doesn't readily grow facial hair. I keep trying, though, even at my age. Once when my oldest was about 4 or five, late at night after he'd gone to bed, I shaved off the mustache and goatee I had grown. When he got up the next morning, he walked in the kitchen where I was probably drinking coffee. His face totally collapsed, and he said, "No, Daddy, put it back."

I'm thinking that as Paul was dealing with dramatic twists in his life, from Pharisee to a mute thrown off his horse, healed and called to preach what he once persecuted. And over and over again a voice from within and without telling him: "leave behind what you are comfortable with. Come over to Macedonia and help us." And he listened to the voice. 

## We looked at US from outside

The last few trips that Mary Pat and I have taken have provided us with a perspective on this land we call **home**. Two years ago we went to the other side of the globe -- going north to south. In March and April we went to the other side of the globe going east to west and north to south – then back again. [We even traveled in time. We had April 10 twice.]

Many of you have asked, "How was it?", and I have answered, "It was wonderful." And it was wonderful. Exciting. There were high points and low points. We looked at "home" from a different perspective. And it was frightening, foreboding, and sobering. In some ways it was depressing, leaving us saying, "What is there to do?" In other ways it prompted motivation to "do something."

But most importantly we have looked at things from a different perspective. I asked myself, "What really matters?"

## The last words of my last sermon

Some of you may remember I ended my last sermon, before we left for the South Pacific with the words, "Do something." That was in response to my sense that Christians could no longer be content with being comfortable. Complacency, in my view, is no longer an option for people who wear the label **"Christian"**. 

Last week, I heard Fr. Peter commend you for the many things that you **are** doing. It's really quite amazing. And I second his words. Well done.

But like Owen looking at my face without the moustache and beard, what was familiar and customary appears to me to be no longer adequate. There is no going back from the changes we are confronting. 

The world outside the US looks at folks with the label **American Christian,** and they see something quite different from what we in this country imagine. We would generally have dinner each night with different folks. The conversation at the table when all of us were from the US was quite predictable. We talked about the food. About the last excursion we went on. The last cruise we were on. Our favorite cruise line. It seemed as if we never talked about deeper subjects. 

When our table partners were international, the conversation seemed to easily shift to some variation of, "What's going on in the US is frightening and crazy." Interestingly there were two couples we befriended that were made up of one US citizen and the spouse who was a citizen of some other country but with a green card.  As March and April unfolded the emotional tenor shifted from bemusement at what was going on in the US, and then gradually fear and uncertainty.

# Question

## Where's the peace?

In today's gospel, Jesus's friends were gathered around him for a grand meal. You know how Jesus loved to share a meal. At this particular meal he had a lot of things to say to them. No doubt his friends were focused on how good it felt to have Jesus with them. They weren't really ready for the message he had for them. "I'm going to leave you. I will leave you with my Shalom. You can take that with you wherever you go. But I have to leave and all you'll have is someone who will advocate for me to you.

"I am going away, and I am coming to you."

No doubt they asked the classic questions. "Wait? What?

He responded, "Things can no longer be the same. Things have changed. You will be moving into uncharted waters. The waters may be choppy, even stormy. But I will be with you.

A little like traveling the South Pacific. A little like coming "home" to a country that has changed in profound ways.

## Rejoice that I am going.

Like Paul who set sail after his vision in today's reading. He and his friends would be launched into a world they could not have anticipated. Just so, we had set sail for the South Pacific before Lent and arrived back in the US after Easter day. Mary Pat said, "We gave up the US for Lent."

Perhaps inevitably we had to come back to a world that was changed. The social contract that I had known from my earliest childhood, the quiet agreement about values and principles, was crumbling or swept away. In some ways I trace an awareness of the social contract back to father. 

He was the one who taught me that a gentleman keeps his word. A gentleman always carries a clean handkerchief. (_He used the word "gentleman", because he was not aware of gender issues the way we are these days_.) That same social contract said, "It is never okay to mock a handicapped person." It said that one is as much a neighbor to the richest as the poorest. He was serious about his Hippocratic Oath, "Thou shalt do no harm."

From my teenage years onward I heard every Sunday the words: "Hear what our Lord Jesus Christ saith: *Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself...*

The country we came home to seems to have canceled the neighbor part of that. Or at least understands "neighbor" in a narrow sense. Not the sense in which Jesus's parable of the Good Samaritan clearly teaches.

## Coming home?

Coming home has really been something of a conundrum for me. Diana Butler-Bass recently wrote that she genuinely doesn't know what to say. And she makes a living by knowing what to say and write. What do you say or do when your world seems to have turned upside down? Mostly I don't know what to say. 

But I'm reminded of my words in January: "Do something."

Home is ever changing. Change is inevitable. An ancient writer said:

"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man"

"Where is the peace?" the disciples might rightly have asked Jesus? Or, "What do we do now?"

# Change

## Where's the peace in change?

The world is changing too quickly. Paul of Tarsus could have said that. The friends of Jesus that night in Jerusalem. I've heard it myself. Plenty of times. 

For myself, for a long time I have found inspiration for taking the next step from things I didn't expect. Places I **least** expected, even. Usually they've been fleeting. For a moment they shine and then they're gone. Annie Dillard provided an image once when a moth flew into a candle flame. It burned in a flash of fire and then its **exoskeleton** burned as a wick for hours. 

On Paul's journey to Macedonia, a chance encounter with a woman merchant named Lydia was such an event. 

> The Lord opened her heart to listen eagerly to what was said by Paul. When she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my home." And she prevailed upon us. 

Such events are why as Christians we are obligated to understand "love your neighbor as yourself" in an expansive way, not as the people like us next door. They may be lying along the road to Jericho. They may not look like us, think like us, speak like us, pray like us. 

But Jesus said to the legal expert, “You have answered correctly,” ... “Do this and you will live.”

## Everything will be okay?

Things may look dismal at the moment. Certainly Jesus's friends at that dinner were in for a startlng awarenes when they looked at him, from a distance, executed on a cross. 

I tell myself the church has lived through the centuries with countless rulers, kings, emperors, and tyrants. It has often looked bleak indeed. 

But just as invariably there have been moments where you can see the "water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city".

There's a saying that keeps me going, taking one step at a time. I laugh to think that I first heard the phrase in a wonderful film about old people moving to India. Some on the internet claim that John Lennon said it, but there appears to be no evidence for that, only that people have repeated it and the internet has multiplied it an unfathomable number of times. 

"Everything will be okay in the end. And if it's not okay it's not the end."

# Apocalyptic

## Bible 101

You know the first thing you learn in Bible 101 about the last book of the Bible is that it is written in the genre known as **apocalyptic**. The second thing you learn is that the purpose the various books in the apocalyptic genre is to **encourage people during times of persecution and suffering**. 

After that, the third through the 150^th^, things you  learn -- well that's kind of all over the place. 

We are now living in **interesting** times. It is for Christians a time of crisis. In Chinese -- I read in Wikipedia -- the word for "crisis" is a combination of **danger** and **change point**. A crossing of paths. 

## Time of persecution

I have read many a piece that claims that the reason for the decline of the Episcopal church is that it became too political, it became over-run with radical leftists and progressives. We live in a digital / global world where firm opinions are held all over the spectrum. 

My own reading is something like the following:

> We live in a time when the core values of Christian faith, indeed the core values that for ages have bound us together, are under siege. 

The opening of John's Revelation addresses 7 churches: ~~Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea~~. He sees that they are doing good things. He commends it. But he also points to their deficiencies of faith or action. 

He says to them:

> you say, ‘I’m rich, and I’ve grown wealthy, and I don’t need a thing.’ 

And that, of course, is not the right response from the churches. John's **revelation** is what follows. 

> If you can hear, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.

And so it begins. A rich, provocative, alluring, vision -- like a kaleidoscopic, slowly unfolding, dream sequence -- a huge metaphoric vision -- that leads to the passage we've heard today. It may not look good now, but in the end it will be glorious. 

> ... the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. Its gates will never be shut by day-- and there will be no night there. People will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. But nothing unclean will enter it, nor anyone who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.

"In the end everything will be okay. If it's not okay now, it's not the end." Things are not okay yet, but in the end it will be glorious.

## Songs

*“For What It’s Worth” is one of the most widely known protest songs of the 1960s. Recorded by Buffalo Springfield as a single, it was eventually released in 1967 on their self-titled album.*

[Verse 2]\
There's battle lines being drawn\
And nobody's right if everybody's wrong\
Young people speaking their minds\
Are gettin' so much resistance from behind

[Chorus]\
It's time we stop\
Hey, what's that sound?\
Everybody look what's going down

# Standing still is not an option

## Paul, Friends

As Paul headed north and west to Macedonia, he had no inkling of the storms that the church would face. There were setbacks and roadblocks. There would be persecutions sponsored by the kings and emperors of the time. But along the way there would also be lights abounding. Beacons of light to shine the way. 

Keep heart and keep your ears focused on the Grace that abounds. Don't stand still. Do something.

# The times they are a changin'

## What do we long for?

It's a time to ask what do we hold fast and what is fleeting? What is the basis for our convictions? What is the priority for our day to day decisions? What motivates each 24 hours that we are given?

Love? Peace? We yearn and long for those. But many  of our neighbors throughout the world don't know where their next meal will be. Many of them don't know if they will even have 24 hours to live. Such as these are our **neighbors**. Paul's missionary work guaranteed that. 

> Love God. Love your neighbor.

We're not there, of course. But we haven't given up either. Be of good cheer -- even in the midst of chaos and conflict, for many of the saints who have gone before us have walked these roads ahead of us.

It will be okay in the end.
