O Lord, we beseech thee mercifully to receive the prayers of  
thy people who call upon thee, and grant that they may both  
perceive and know what things they ought to do, and also  
may have grace and power faithfully to fulfill the same;  
through Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with  
thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.Â _Amen._
