Zach forgot about our appointment at Church.

- Peter wanted me to give him feedback about NT Wright: *Jesus & Power* or some such
- Talking with Bill, he reported that Emma is in a lot of financial trouble. Owen has orchestrated some of fund for getting her a car. He reported to Bill that the last he and I had talked there was "bad blood" I don't remember such a thing. So he hasn't involved me.
