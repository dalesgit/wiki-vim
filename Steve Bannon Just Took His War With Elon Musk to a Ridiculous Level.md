Steve Bannon thinks that Americans deserve reparations for having to coexist with immigrants on H-1B visas.

“We haven’t fought these battles over years and years and years to allow American citizens of every race, ethnicity, religion, be gutted by the sociopathic overlords in Silicon Valley,” Bannon [opined on his *War Room* show](https://x.com/Bannons_WarRoom/status/1873763299654836278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1873763299654836278%7Ctwgr%5E963e626eaae10e77a5b777b008fa5c66fd69b1e3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwarroom.org%2Fsteve-bannon-demands-reparations-for-displaced-american-tech-workers-you-stole-their-future%2F) Monday morning. “David Sacks, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Elon Musk … there’s no reform. We want it gone.… We want reparations for the tech workers that you stole their lives.”

This is another installment in the current schism between the “America First” MAGA faithful and the tech-world MAGA plutocrats who want more high-skilled immigrants. Former presidential candidate and current DOGE co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy [started the fire](https://newrepublic.com/post/189681/vivek-ramaswamy-american-workers-suck-maga-reaction) last week by declaring, “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” asserting that it was American culture that was leading CEOs to look elsewhere for labor. This talking point was parroted by Elon Musk and other right-wing techies, inviting a MAGA backlash that even included Nikki Haley, the torchbearer of the old GOP establishment who was vanquished by Trump earlier this year.

“There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture,” Haley [wrote](https://x.com/NikkiHaley/status/1872344248915554712). “All you have to do is look at the border and see how many want what we have. We should be investing and prioritizing in Americans, not foreign workers.”

This anti-H-1B energy has culminated in Bannon’s calls for reparations, something usually invoked for African Americans historically disenfranchised by slavery and racism.

“We’re gonna get H-1B visas out, root and stem, and all the workers you brought in. Just like we’re deporting 15 million here, we want them deported, out,” Bannon said later in his show. “And give those jobs to American citizens today … we demand they get reparations. You stole from them.”

Donald Trump tried to stem the growing tide against House Speaker Mike Johnson Monday with a post endorsing his reelection, but whether all House Republicans are actually interested in getting back on the bandwagon is another issue entirely.

In a [rambling post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113742374534233751) on Truth Social Monday, Trump urged the “Party of COMMON SENSE” to support Johnson’s bid to keep the gavel in the new year.

“LETS NOT BLOW THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY WHICH WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN. The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!” he wrote. Most of the post’s word count was dedicated to his own “flawless” reelection campaign.

![Truth Social screenshot Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump: We are the Party of COMMON SENSE, a primary reason that we WON, in a landslide, the magnificent and historic Presidential Election of 2024. ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, 312 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, AND THE POPULAR VOTE BY MILLIONS OF VOTERS (Despite large scale voter fraud taking place in numerous states, including California, where votes are ridiculously still being counted, or under review!), ALL WON WITH EASE, CALM, & PROFESSIONALISM. Republicans are being praised for having run a “legendary” campaign! Democrats are being excoriated for their effort, having wasted 2.5 Billion Dollars, much of it unaccounted for, with some being used to illegally buy endorsements ($11,000,000 to Beyoncé, who never even sang a song, $2,000,000 to Oprah for doing next to nothing, and even $500,000 to Reverend AL, a professional con man and instigator, who agreed to “interview” their “star spangled” candidates, Kamala and Joe). We ran a flawless campaign, having spent FAR LESS, with lots of money left over. They ran a very expensive “sinking ship,” embracing DOJ & FBI WEAPONIZATION against their political opponent, ME.

In voicing his support for Johnson, Trump has set up yet another loyalty test for House Republicans.

Earlier this month, Johnson came under fire after introducing a 1,547-page continuing resolution to keep the government open until March, among a slew of other bipartisan provisions, inviting the outrage of small-government types like technocrat billionaire Elon Musk, and a slate of sycophantic Republicans.

Republican Representative Thomas Massie was so distraught that he [claimed](https://newrepublic.com/post/189546/mike-johnson-thomas-massie-speaker-vote) he would not vote for Johnson in the upcoming House speaker election in January.

Johnson then worked with Trump on crafting another spending bill that suspended the debt ceiling, one of the president-elect’s core demands. But this time, 38 House Republicans [broke with Trump](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/12/20/congress/trump-gop-primary-house-members-00195576) and voted against the bill. In the end, Trump’s demand that Republicans find a way to raise or abolish the debt ceiling got left on the cutting room floor.

Last week, Representative Andy Harris, who chairs the far-right House Freedom Caucus, [said](https://newrepublic.com/post/189687/republicans-holiday-break-war-mike-johnson) that Republicans need to think about whether their current leadership “is what we need” and that he was “undecided” on what House leadership should look like moving forward.

More than a few other Republicans have [similarly](https://x.com/maxpcohen/status/1873722814773244126) voiced their dissatisfaction with Johnson, as it seems that the GOP’s antiestablishment bent has turned against the party itself.

Elon Musk is asking you to make X a more upbeat place.

The tech billionaire pleaded with his 209 million X followers on Sunday, placing the onus of change for his dwindling social media investment on site users rather than himself.  

“Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” Musk [posted](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1873417011294093499).

X accounts were quick to throw the ball back into Musk’s court, urging him to create an algorithm where positive content could actually proliferate.

“You first,” [snapped](https://x.com/UnrealBluegrass/status/1873417663575457978) back lawyer and bluegrass banjo player Steve Martin.

“Getting tired of the toxic wasteland you created?” [replied](https://x.com/PiperK/status/1873422748493762873) author Karen Piper.

Musk likely began to notice his site’s more toxic elements after he became enmeshed in a [far-right feud](https://newrepublic.com/post/189694/steve-bannon-maga-war-elon-musk-immigration) over H-1B work visas last week. Last week, Musk vowed to “go to war on this issue,” insisting that foreign tech workers need to be allowed to work in the U.S. due to a “permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent.” That resulted in a backlash that has framed Musk and other H-1B proponents, like unofficial DOGE co-chair Vivek Ramaswamy, as MAGA targets amid Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. (The H-1B visa program has an annual cap set by Congress, admitting 65,000 foreign workers per year. In 2023, it was estimated that there were more than 700,000 H-1B visa holders in the U.S., according to data from the [American Immigration Council](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/h1b-visa-program-fact-sheet).)

But surely, if anyone is to blame for the site’s increasingly volatile and disturbing content, it’s none other than Musk himself.

In the early days of Musk’s takeover, Twitter witnessed a [mass exodus](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html) of employees, with Musk claiming he was simply trimming fat by firing upwards of 80 percent of site staff. His “free speech agenda” has further capped and [undermined](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/22/elon-musk-twitter-content-moderations/) the site’s content moderation abilities, allowing dangerous rhetoric to flow freely on his platform. His dismantling of the site’s infrastructure has also translated to monumental changes on the website that have proved overwhelmingly unpopular. His tweaked algorithm has aggressively promoted advertisements and reshare accounts, restructured threads to the point that they no longer elevate relevant replies, and has even [swapped code](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/14/23600358/elon-musk-tweets-algorithm-changes-twitter) to ensure his own posts universally appear at the top of users’ timelines.

But despite his plea, even the most unsavory posts haven’t seemed to disturb Musk, who has himself spread [Nazi conspiracies](https://newrepublic.com/post/176980/elon-musk-antisemitism-actual-truth) via his personal account, and allowed [105 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/20/antisemitic-tweets-soared-twitter-after-musk-took-over-study-finds/) more antisemitic hate speech to spread on the platform, according to a 2023 study.

Last year, the tech billionaire admitted that the site had lost [90 percent](https://fortune.com/2023/09/06/elon-musk-x-what-is-twitter-worth/) of its value since he acquired it for $44 billion in 2022.

More on how this fight is going:

A three-star U.S. Army general thinks that Elon Musk’s foreign business relationships could make him a significant threat to national security. 

Retired Lieutenant General Russel Honoré argued in a Sunday [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/29/opinion/elon-musk-china-classified-secrets-national-security-russia-doge.html) column that the SpaceX CEO’s willingness to capitulate to Chinese demands over the years should make his recent influence within Trump’s circle all the more questionable.  

Honoré referenced 2023 quotes from Musk’s DOGE buddy Vivek Ramaswamy to make his case. “I have no reason to think Elon won’t jump like a circus monkey when Xi Jinping calls in the hour of need,” Ramaswamy said in an interview. “It’s deeply concerning that @elonmusk met with China’s foreign minister yesterday to oppose decoupling and referred to the U.S. & Communist China as ‘conjoined twins,’” he [wrote](https://x.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1664022522835226627) in another statement that year. “The U.S. needs leaders who aren’t in China’s pocket.”

Ramaswamy has since made amends with Musk, but his concerns still apply. Musk and SpaceX have already been flagged thrice by the Air Force, the Defense Department’s Office of Inspector General, and the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security for [failing to disclose](https://newrepublic.com/post/189501/elon-musk-federal-review-clearance-rules) his meetings with foreign leaders, something his current security clearance requires him to do. And his China business isn’t going anywhere either. 

Musk has borrowed at least [$1.4 billion from Chinese government–controlled banks](https://insideevs.com/news/539191/tesla-paid-shanghai-gigafactory-loan/) to pay for his massive Tesla “gigafactory” in Shanghai. He borrowed this money knowing full well that China’s laws allow the Chinese Communist Party to demand information from any company doing business in China in exchange for doing business there—a huge red flag for Honoré.

“Mr. Musk’s business dealings in China [could](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/asia/china-state-secrets-law.html) require him to hand over sensitive classified information, learned either through his business interests or his proximity to President-elect Donald Trump. No federal agency has accused him of disclosing such material, but as Mr. Ramaswamy [put it](https://youtu.be/q1BEyKgnHkU?si=hoElCn0aDq98gf9Q&t=168), China has recognized that U.S. companies are fickle,” Honoré wrote. “Mr. Musk’s relationship with China’s leaders could prove a problem for America’s national security given that SpaceX has a [near monopoly](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-spacex-now-has-a-de-facto-monopoly-on-rocket-launches-3c34f02e) on the United States’ rocket launches … the last thing the United States needs is for China to potentially have an easier way of obtaining classified intelligence and national security information.”

This has drawn the ire of Democrats and Republicans alike. In 2022, Senator Marco Rubio [accused](https://x.com/SenMarcoRubio/status/1478090139406684165) Tesla of obstructing justice for the CCP, and in 2023 he [introduced a bill](https://newrepublic.com/article/189733/3-star-general-thinks-elon-musk-national-security-threat) to stop NASA and other federal agencies from giving contracts to companies connected to the Chinese Communist Party. Two Democratic senators very recently called for a probe into Musk’s “reliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder” because of his reported phone call with Vladimir Putin. 

The line between civilian and elected official has become blurrier as Musk further cements himself as part of Trump’s inner circle. As Honoré wrote, the world’s richest man funding Trump’s return to the presidency “does not give the incoming White House the license to look the other way at the national security risks he may pose.”

President Joe Biden is funneling funds to Ukraine before Donald Trump takes the reins on America’s response to the international conflict.

The departing leader announced $6 billion in additional military and budget assistance to Ukraine on Monday. Approximately $1.25 billion in military aid stems from U.S. stockpiles, with another $1.22 billion coming from the final Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package from Biden’s term, reported [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-announces-25-billion-fresh-military-aid-ukraine-2024-12-30/). Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also said that the U.S. has made available $3.4 billion in additional budget aid to Ukraine amid its ongoing conflict with Russia.

“The Department of Defense is in the process of delivering hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles which will strengthen Ukraine’s hand as it heads into the winter,” Biden said in a [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/30/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-u-s-support-for-ukraines-defense/). “At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.”

The funds will be used for critical resources and longer-term supplies of air defense, artillery, and other weapons systems, according to Biden.

More than 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been [killed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv75nydy3o) since Russia invaded the Eastern European nation in February 2022. Cities have been leveled, and 370,000 injuries have been reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier this month. But Biden’s exit from the White House could mark the end of the U.S. commitment to aiding the war-torn nation.

One of Trump’s biggest and boldest campaign promises was that he would [immediately end](https://newrepublic.com/post/188249/putin-russia-troops-trump-warning-ukraine) the Russian invasion of Ukraine—though his philosophy on how to achieve that was suspiciously scant of details and, at times, veered toward solutions that would invariably aid Russia.

In June, details dished by some of Trump’s advisers suggested that Trump would [be open](https://newrepublic.com/post/183073/trump-ukraine-planand-gives-putin-exactly-wants) to an increase in U.S. weapons aid to Ukraine so long as it shows up for peace talks with Russia. The advisers envisioned that the peace talks would also quietly include Ukraine ceding part of the country that is currently occupied by Russian forces.

And some of Trump’s domestic decisions are reportedly “[thrilling](https://newrepublic.com/post/189516/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-plan-manipulate)” Russian mouthpieces. Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT, claimed earlier this month that some of Trump’s most [unqualified choices](https://newrepublic.com/post/188908/donald-trump-appointments-kushner-boulos) for his Cabinet—such as DOGE co-chair nominee Vivek Ramaswamy and director of national intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard—are friendly faces that bring the Kremlin “lots of joy.”

Meanwhile, NATO (which Trump has long threatened to withdraw the U.S. from) is preparing for escalations on the Russian front. In early December, NATO chief Mark Rutte warned members that the international alliance must shift to a “[wartime mindset](https://newrepublic.com/post/189346/nato-chief-warns-necessary-shift-wartime-mindset),” predicting years of conflict with Russia as the superpower batters down Ukrainian forces.

“Russia is preparing for long-term confrontation, with Ukraine and with us,” Rutte said during a [speech](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_231348.htm) in Brussels in which he highlighted the short distance to where “Russian bombs are falling … Iranian drones are flying,” and “North Korean soldiers are fighting.”

“We are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years,” the secretary-general continued. “It is time to shift to a wartime mindset, and turbocharge our defense production and defense spending.”

Donald Trump’s request for a new trial in E. Jean Carroll’s defamation and sexual abuse case against him was shut down by a federal appeals court Monday.

In a new [77-page filing](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca2.60504/gov.uscourts.ca2.60504.176.1.pdf), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the original verdict from the district court that Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll in 1996, then defaming her in 2022.

“On review for abuse of discretion, we conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings,” the filing stated. “Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial.”

Trump’s attorneys had argued that the May 2023 verdict should be thrown out because U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan should not have allowed jurors to hear testimony from two other women, Jessica Leeds and Natasha Stoynoff, who also accused the president-elect of sexual misconduct.

The appeals court, however, ruled that the district court “did not abuse its discretion” in admitting their testimonies into evidence.

Trump’s lawyers also tried to argue that the judge should not have allowed the jury to view the 2005 *Access Hollywood* tape, in which Trump claimed that “when you’re a star” women will let you “grab them” by their genitals, a video that many people not on the jury have also seen.

The court ruled that the inclusion of the tape into evidence was “relevant to prove that the alleged sexual assault actually occurred.”

American flags will be flying at half-mast for Trump’s January 20 inauguration after the [death](https://newrepublic.com/article/170785/jimmy-carter-dies-shapiro-obit) of former President Jimmy Carter on Sunday at age 100.

Federal guidelines state that the flag must be “half-staff for 30 days at all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and its territories and possessions after the death of the president or a former president.”

President-elect Trump has yet to mention the flags, and offered condolences to the Carter family.

“I just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,” Trump [wrote in a Truth Social post](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113738366140404718) on Sunday that [angered some of the MAGA faithful](https://newrepublic.com/post/189712/trump-jimmy-carter-maga-reaction-pissed). “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.”

Given Trump’s general obsession with appearances, such as the [crowd size](https://newrepublic.com/post/187023/donald-trump-crowd-size-embarrassing-video-empty) at his first inauguration, he may well feel emasculated by a half-mast American flag at his second one.

Nearly half of Republicans support Donald Trump’s plan to use the U.S. military to forcibly round up undocumented immigrants into camps and deport them en masse.

A [postelection survey](https://www.prri.org/research/analyzing-the-2024-presidential-vote-prris-post-election-survey/#:~:text=should%20put%20undocumented-,immigrants,-into%20internment%20camps) by the Public Religion Research Institute, or PRRI, found that 46 percent of Republicans supported using the military to enact sweeping deportation raids and widespread internment.

Meanwhile, only 9 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of independents endorsed the idea. Twenty-six percent of all voters surveyed endorsed the plan.

PRRI surveyed 5,772 U.S. adults between November 8 and December 2.

Robert P. Jones, PRRI’s president and founder, [told Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/30/gop-voters-support-military-immigrants-camps) on Monday that there was good news and bad news.

“I guess the good news is that three-quarters of the country rejects this idea that we should be putting immigrants in the country illegally into internment camps guarded by the military,” Jones said. The bad news is that support for Trump’s extreme plot is apparently supported by nearly half the members of a mainstream political party.

Trump has [claimed](https://newrepublic.com/post/188533/donald-trump-plan-mass-deportations-military) he will use the military to carry out mass deportations and has promised to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1789 to expel suspected members of drug cartels from the country without due process. Trump’s extreme immigration views suggest that his administration would plan to target more than violent criminals, undermining protections for legal immigrants as well.

Trump’s new “border czar,” Tom Homan, [previously said](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1856352692299301150) that he expected support from the U.S. military and special operations to carry out their immigration blitz.

They’re not talking about just camps:

Alt-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer’s [fiery spat](https://newrepublic.com/post/189682/maga-laura-loomer-elon-musk-fight) with Elon Musk has quietly ended with a bent knee and a plea for the X chief to reinstate her blue check status on his website.

“I appreciated the conversation last night with @AdrianDittmann and others,” Loomer wrote, referring to an individual that has been widely speculated to be Musk’s burner account. “It was productive & informative, and I look forward to more of these conversations in the future. I also hope that @elonmusk will agree to reinstate my @premium features.”

Loomer, a self-described journalist and “[white advocate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/14/trump-ally-laura-loomer-audio),” went [head-to-head](https://newrepublic.com/post/189682/maga-laura-loomer-elon-musk-fight) with Musk last week over the billionaire’s ardent defense of the H-1B work visa program.

In several posts, Loomer accused Musk of having “bought his way into MAGA,” claimed he was a pawn of China, and said that the “divorce” between the “stage 5 clinger” and President-elect Donald Trump was on the horizon.

That was apparently enough back talk to [strip Loomer of her verified status](https://newrepublic.com/post/189683/elon-musk-critics-x-immigration-paid-price-verification) on the site—a loss that, for her, warranted backtracking on her previous positions.

“My comments do not come from hate, but rather compassion for the struggle of the everyday American,” she continued in a [separate post](https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1873427106396512618). “I believe loyalty is the most important quality, and I am loyal to my country and my people. I want what’s best for Americans. And I will always keep fighting for Americans.”

Loomer’s renowned Islamophobia and xenophobia were extreme enough to shove her temporarily away from the MAGA movement earlier this year after she posted that Vice President Kamala Harris’s ascendency to the Oval Office would make the White House “[smell like curry](https://newrepublic.com/post/185940/donald-trump-lindsey-graham-marjorie-taylor-greene-laura-loomer).” Loomer has also taken [credit](https://x.com/EyesOnTheRight/status/1835685237268811883) for urging Trump to utter the Haitian migrant conspiracy theory that wrecked Ohio in the months leading up to the election.

Meanwhile, the account that supposedly convinced Loomer to concede the fight has some otherwise [inexplicable ties](https://charlesjohnson.substack.com/p/how-elon-musks-twitter-alt-account) to the Tesla CEO. Dittmann also purports to be a South African billionaire with identical beliefs to Musk. The account frequently responds to Musk’s posts, supporting his decisions related to his forthcoming government positions and the way in which the tech leader is raising his children. But the account also, at times, goes so far as to speak on behalf of Musk, organizing events with Musk’s friends while continuing to claim that the two aren’t affiliated.

X users felt that the illusion was completely shattered over the weekend, when Dittman participated in an X space using his actual voice—and, suspiciously, had the exact same cadence, accent, and vocal intonations as Musk himself.

More on th MAGA civil war:

Donald Trump’s public condolences for former President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at the age of 100 on Sunday, sparked an uproar among his own fans.

“I just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113738366140404718) on Truth Social Sunday.

“The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude,” Trump wrote. “Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.”

Apparently, that relatively simple statement was too much for some in the MAGA crowd, [according](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-fans-disagree-carter-statement/) to RawStory.

“Lol, I know you’re being nice. But you’re tripping,” replied an account called Theodore Winters. “Carter was a terrible president and damaged The United States Of America to such an extent that we are STILL dealing with his horribly policy decisions and his inflation repercussions in 2024.”

“I get it. He just passed. And we have to be respectful and nice. But let’s still keep it real,” Winters added.

An account called Commieskillpuppies noted that the president-elect’s words wouldn’t have any political value. “I appreciate your graciousness toward him but it won’t win you any points from the leftists,” the user wrote. “They’re soulless.”

One user, John55, who identified himself as an “America First” veteran on his profile, complained that Carter had pardoned draft dodgers during the Vietnam War—with no recognition that Trump himself [dodged the Vietnam War draft](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-avoided-the-military-draft-which-was-common-at-the-time-vietnam-war-2018-12).

“Jimmy Carter pardoned all the Vietnam draft dodgers that forced other men to take their place! Many of these men did not come home,” the user wrote. “Personally, I think Carter lived a long life to suffer for the pardons to the draft dodgers he pardoned.”

It’s possible that these reactions were just adjusting to the shock of the president-elect’s standard condolence statement, especially seeing how Trump has disparaged Carter in the past.

After Joe Biden’s disastrous presidential debate performance in June, Trump claimed that Carter was the “[happiest guy around](https://newrepublic.com/post/183570/trump-unusual-sudden-love-cnn-debate-moderators)” because he now “looked like a genius” compared to Biden. The thirty-ninth president was in hospice at the time.
