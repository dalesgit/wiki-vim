## Wednesday morning prayer 

### Psalm 86

Bring joy to me,\
your servant, Lord,\
I offer myself to you.\
Hear me, Lord, and act, I am poor and helpless.
You are my God, watch over me,
for I am loyal to you.
Save me, your servant, for I trust you.
Each waking hour
I beg your mercy, Lord.
Bring joy to me, your servant, I offer myself to you.
You are good and forgiving, loyal to all who call on you.
Hear my prayer, O Lord, answer my cry for help.
In my despair I plead, knowing you will act.
No god can match you, Lord, you outdo all others.
Every nation you formed will come to worship and honor your name.
You are mighty and work great wonders.
You alone are God!
Mark your path, Lord, that I may follow your truth.
Make my one desire to revere your name.
With all I am, I thank you, God, and honor your name for ever.
Your love for me is great, it saves me from the grave.
The proud rise against me, brutal gangs seek my life, with no thought of you.
But you are Lord of mercy and care, a God slow to anger, full of loyalty and love.
Turn to me, pity me,
strengthen your daughter's child, rescue your servant.
Show me a sign of your love to shock and disgrace my enemy.
Bring help and comfort, Lord. •

### Psalm 98

With sound of trumpet and horn, shout to the Lord, our king.
Sing to the Lord a new song, the Lord of wonderful deeds.
Right hand and holy arm brought victory to God.
God made that victory known, revealed justice to nations, remembered a merciful love loyal to the house of Israel.
The ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.
Shout to the Lord, you earth, break into song, into praise!
Sing praise to God with a harp, with a harp and sound of music.
With sound of trumpet and horn, shout to the Lord, our king.
Let the sea roar with its creatures, the world and all that live there!
Let rivers clap their hands, the hills ring out their joy!
The Lord our God comes, comes to rule the earth, justly to rule the world, to govern the peoples aright. •

## Wednesday Evening prayer

## Psalm 126

Those sowing in tears reap, singing and laughing.
The Lord brings us back to Zion, we are like dreamers, laughing, dancing, with songs on our lips.
Other nations say,
"A new world of wonders!
The Lord is with them." Yes, God works wonders.
Rejoice! Be glad!
Lord, bring us back as water to thirsty land.
Those sowing in tears reap, singing and laughing.
They left weeping, weeping, casting the seed.
They come back singing, singing, holding high the harvest. •
How foolish to rise early and slave until night for bread.
Those who please God receive as much even while they sleep.
Children are God's gift,
a blessing to those who bear them; like arrows in the hand of an archer are children born to the young.
Happy those with a full quiver: facing their enemies at the gate, they stand without shame! •

## Thursday Morning Prayer

### Psalm 87

Great is your renown, city of God.
Zion is set on the holy mountain.
The Lord loves her gates above all the dwellings of Israel.
Great is your renown, city of God.
I register as her citizens
Egypt and Babylon, Philistia, Ethiopia, and Tyre:
"Each one was born in her."
People will say, "Zion mothered each and every one."
The Most High protects the city.
God records in the register,
"This one was born here."
Then people will dance and sing,
"My home is here!" •

### Psalm 99

Bow down to worship God, give praise in this holy place.
The Lord reigns from the cherubim throne, nations tremble, earth shakes!
The Lord of Zion is great, high above all peoples.
Praise the great and fearful name,
"Holy is the Lord!"
Almighty ruler, you love justice, you strengthen the upright and secure equity for Jacob.
Bow down to worship at God's feet, lift your voice in praise,
"Holy is the Lord!"
First among priests of the Lord were Moses, Aaron, and Samuel; they called out God's Name.
The Lord heard them
and spoke from a pillar of cloud; they honored each command.
Our God did what was needed, it was yours, Lord, to punish, yours to forgive sin.
Bow down to worship the Lord, give praise in God's holy place,
"Holy is the Lord our God!" •

## Thursday evening prayer

### Psalm 132:1-9

Lord, let your saints rejoice as they go to your house.
Lord, remember David in all his humility.
He swore an oath to you, O Mighty God of Jacob:
"I will not enter my home, nor lie down on my bed.
I will not close my eyes nor will I sleep
until I find a place for the Lord, a house for the Mighty God of Jacob." We heard about it in Ephrata, in the fields of Yaarim:
"Let us go to God's house, let us worship at God's throne."
Lord, come to your resting place, you and your ark of power.
May your priests dress for the feast, and your faithful shout for joy.

### 132:10-18

I will bless Zion with abundance, even the poor will have food.
Be loyal to David, your servant, do not reject your anointed.
You once swore to David and will not break your word:
"Your child will ascend your throne.
"If your heirs then keep my laws, if they keep my covenant, their children will rule from your throne for ever." The Lord has chosen Zion, desired it as a home.
"This is my resting place, I choose to live here for ever.
"I will bless it with abundance, even the poor will have food.
I will vest the priests in holiness, and the faithful will shout for joy.
"Here I will strengthen David's power and light a lamp for my anointed.
His enemies I will clothe in shame, but on him a crown will shine." O

## Friday morning prayer

### Psalm 51

Have mercy, tender God, forget that I defied you.
Have mercy, tender God, forget that I defied you.
Wash away my sin, cleanse me from my guilt.
I know my evil well, it stares me in the face, evil done to you alone before your very eyes.
How right your condemnation!
Your verdict clearly just.
You see me for what I am, a sinner before my birth.
You love those centered in truth; teach me your hidden wisdom.
Wash me with fresh water, wash me bright as snow.
Fill me with happy songs,
let the bones you bruised now dance.
Shut your eyes to my sin, make my guilt disappear.
Creator, reshape my heart, God, steady my spirit.
Do not cast me aside stripped of your holy spirit.
Save me, bring back my joy, support me, strengthen my will.
Then I will teach your way and sinners will turn to you.
Help me, stop my tears, and I will sing your goodness.
Lord, give me words
and I will shout your praise.
When I offer a holocaust, the gift does not please you.
So I offer my shattered spirit; a changed heart you welcome.
In your love make Zion lovely, rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
Then sacrifice will please you, young bulls upon your altar. o

### Psalm 100

The Lord is our shepherd and we the flock.
Shout joy to the Lord, all earth, serve the Lord with gladness, enter God's presence with joy!
Know that the Lord is God, our maker to whom we belong, our shepherd, and we the flock.
Enter the temple gates,
the courtyard with thanks and praise; give thanks and bless God's name.
Indeed the Lord is good!
God's love is for ever, faithful from age to age. D

## Friday evening prayer

### Psalm 135:1-12

Sing hymns, for God is good; sing God's name, our delight.
Praise the name of the Lord, give praise, faithful servants, who stand in the courtyard, gathered at God's house.
Sing hymns, for God is good.
Sing God's name, our delight, for the Lord chose Jacob, Israel as a special treasure.
I know the Lord is great, surpassing every little god.
What God wills, God does in heaven and earth, in the deepest sea.
God blankets earth with clouds, strikes lightning for the rain, releases wind from the storehouse.
God killed Egypt's firstborn, both humans and beasts, doing wondrous signs in Egypt against Pharoah and his aides.
God struck down nations, killed mighty kings,
Sihon, king of the Amorites, Og, king of Bashan, all the kings of Canaan.
Then God gave Israel their land, a gift for them to keep. •

### 135:13-21

Bless God, house of Israel; sing God's name, our delight.
Your name lives for ever, Lord, your renown never fades, for you give your people justice and attend to their needs.
Pagan idols are silver and gold crafted by human hands.
Their mouths cannot speak, their eyes do not see.
Their ears hear nothing, their nostrils do not breathe.
Their makers who rely on them become like these hollow images.
Bless God, house of Israel, house of Aaron, house of Levi, every faithful one.
Blest be the Lord of Zion, who calls Jerusalem home.
Hallelujah!o

## Saturday morning prayer

### Psalm 119 145 to 152

You, O Lord, are close; your law is my whole truth.
My heart begs you, Lord: hear me, so I can keep faith.
I beg you, make me free, so I can live your laws.
I face you in the cold night praying, waiting for your word.
I keep watch through the night, repeating what you promise.
Hear me, loving God,
let your justice make me live.
The wicked close in on me; to them your law is foreign.
But you, Lord, are closer still, your law is my whole truth, learned when I was young, fixed for all time. •

### Psalm 117

Strong the love embracing us.
Faithful the Lord for ever.
Praise! Give glory to God!
Nations, peoples, give glory!
Strong the love embracing us.
Faithful the Lord for ever.
Hallelujah! •
