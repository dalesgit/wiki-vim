# Gratitude Journal
## Sun 08 Sep 2024 
I was sleeping so soundly when I woke up and then I felt weary. I don't look forward to celebrating and then facilitating discussion. But grateful that I have a place and a role that contributes in some ways to people's lives. I felt energized last night. I recognized that when I celebrate I give it my all, even for fewer than 20.

- fresh coffee in the morning
- wordle seemed challenging the last 2 days, but I got them
- celebrated Mass. Connected with Richard (of Carol) in the back.
- Tricia is going to study the liturgy. I recommended that she google "instructed Eucharist".

- that EJI reminds me of the injustices perpetrated in my "west" e.g. against Chinese
- at the gym I did Spinning with my hand slung off of the machine. Kalani's guess about what caused the **spikes** is **not** correct.

- It feels like lots of normal results from the cardiac testing.

[cardiology](cardiology.md): I have isolated some of the clue about my spiking heart rate when "spinning" at gym. I don't yet know if it has to do with the spinning

Today I did the Spinning first. I got a spike, but I quickly tried to pull back the intensity. I only had one. But evidently it is the "Spinning" that initiates the episode.
