[cardiology](cardiology.md): I have isolated some of the clue about my spiking heart rate when "spinning" at gym. I don't yet know if it has to do with the spinning

Today I did the Spinning first. I got a spike, but I quickly tried to pull back the intensity. I only had one. But evidently it is the "Spinning" that initiates the episode.
