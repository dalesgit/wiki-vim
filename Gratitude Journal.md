# Gratitude Journal

## 2024-10-15 Tue

Good sleep. Time away. Limited responsibilities for a few days.

## 2024-10-13 Sun

For the normal (e.g. electrical) that we have at this place in Orlando. For getting folding and cleaning up the use of nvim and obsidian.nvim.

## 2024-10-12 Sat

We are headed to Orlando. Electricity? Such a pathetic thing to be craving, but there it is. Wed at 10pm it went out. Yesterday we really had something of a normal experience, going out to eat.

## 06 Oct 2024 Sun 06:28 AM

The time spent with Julian.

For the time alone as I got up early and went for cup of coffee.

## 04 Oct 2024 Fri 07:49 AM

Glad to have arrived in Colorado.

## 2024-10-03 Thursday

The cleaning I was able to get done yesterday. For the new selfie stick. For the new ear pods. For my homemade bread.

## 02 Oct 2024 Wed 09:28 AM

For praying together. Having a system. For the tripod/selfie-stick that may work for me with my Thursday sessions.

## 2024-10-01 Tue

For the way in which Moses walked into my life with the reading of Lectio. For the gym yesterday and the lectures on [freedom.](freedom..md)

## 2024-09-30 Monday

I'm pretty impressed with working with nvim. Yesterday Miriam had a smiling response to our birthday wishes and gift.

I was turned off of church. I thought it was boring. But I was buoyed by the recognition that Linda's gift to me about **panentheism** was easier for me to burrow down in than the **pantheism** of so many that seems shallow. In the midst of the sermon, I could project my spirit into the fleeting perception and awareness of God that I have known and see that it was there that all these elements in the (boring) St. Alfred's were actually to be found.

## 2024-09-28

My bowels seem to have returned to more or less normal this morning. From Sunday to now.

Grateful that we were spared destruction with Hurricane Helene. Not-glad that so many other people were impacted -- from Holly in St. Pete. to Larry above Asheville and all [[MP]]'s family.

## 2024-09-25 Wed 07:19 AM

The Hurricane approaches. Both of us are glad that the tree is down.

Lots of tugging back and forth. I spend a lot of energy resisting her negativity and in myself when she doesn't really pay attention to me. l

## Mon 23 Sep 2024

Colonoscopy in a few hours. Life may return.

## Sun 22 Sep 2024

There is slightly less apprehension about "my last meal". My day of clear liquids has begun and I'm kind of slowly sailing into myself.

## Sat 21 Sep 2024

Elaine's comment to MP that my thank you note had been "over the top".
my system for note taking is getting more natural and I'm smoothing over the hiccoughs.

## Fri 20 Sep 2024

The McDonald's breakfast tasted **so** good. This morning I began my regimen for the colonoscopy on Monday.
Grateful for figuring out the Iphone / Logseq / Github issue last night. It took ca. 2 hours total fiddling, but I figured out that I was inadvertently creating the folder in **Icloud** rather than on the phone. I missed it because the option wasn't visible -- I had to guess where to toggle the option. The symptom was that I was able to "pull" the repository with "Working Copy" but not commit or push.

## Thu 19 Sep 2024

I had forgot Mary Pat's Boston Cream Pie. It came up again at the dinner with Fran and Joey when I commented that the dinner was kind of like a birthday dinner for [MP](MP.md). It was a month anniversary of her birth anniversary.

[dream](dream.md) They seem closer to **fulfillment** than they used to be when they were more **frustration**.

## Wed 18 Sep 2024

I feel a relief with the stump of the tree ground up. One giant step taken.
My colonoscopy upcoming. Then the trip to Colorado.
A wonderful meal in St. Petersburg, Treasure Island, with Joe and Fran. We didn't talk much about: Sex, Politics, and Religion. But it was a time for Mary Pat to be with her sister.

## Tue 17 Sep 2024

For the lectio reading last night -- the paraphrase of Psalm 137. Cf. notes in Joplin
Giant tree is gone. All that's left is the stump. That stump is reminiscent of _The Giving Tree_. Also **Elijah's chair**. Musical chairs.

## Fri 13 Sep 2024

The opportunity to be a part of the SD class.
The cartoon to send to Owen about sons doing the opposite of their fathers.

## Thu 12 Sep 2024

Food to eat. Expectation of seeing Julian soon.

## Wed 11 Sep 2024

Again I got up only once in the night.
The 30 minutes at the pool yesterday
The notes and reading I accomplished re. [spiritual direction.md](spiritual direction.md)
delicious salmon dinner

## Tue 10 Sep 2024

Nothing on the calendar.
the ease with which my slicer cut through celery (and others)
note-taking on Guenther [spiritual direction.md](spiritual direction.md)

## Mon 09 Sep 2024

For today's lectio. For the mp3 player I may start working with.
_Peace like a River_, Leif Enger. novel recommended by Peter. MP read it. She loved its writing, including a vision of near death experience. Sounded like first time I read _Perelandra_.

## Sun 08 Sep 2024

I was sleeping so soundly when I woke up and then I felt weary. I don't look forward to celebrating and then facilitating discussion. But grateful that I have a place and a role that contributes in some ways to people's lives. I felt energized last night. I recognized that when I celebrate I give it my all, even for fewer than 20.

## Sat 07 Sep 2024

fresh coffee in the morning
wordle seemed challenging the last 2 days, but I got them
celebrated Mass. Connected with Richard (of Carol) in the back.
Tricia is going to study the liturgy. I recommended that she google "instructed Eucharist".

## Fri 06 Sep 2024

Moving forward with [MP.md](MP.md) going to gym (or back into therapy)

## Thu 05 Sep 2024

that EJI reminds me of the injustices perpetrated in my "west" e.g. against Chinese
at the gym I did Spinning with my hand slung off of the machine. Kalani's guess about what caused the **spikes** is **not** correct.

## Wed 04 Sep 2024

It feels like lots of normal results from the cardiac testing.
writing notes on Guenther (SD)

## Tue 03 Sep 2024 03:16:53 PM EDT

[cardiology](cardiology.md): I have isolated some of the clue about my spiking heart rate when "spinning" at gym. I don't yet know if it has to do with the spinning

Today I did the Spinning first. I got a spike, but I quickly tried to pull back the intensity. I only had one. But evidently it is the "Spinning" that initiates the episode.
