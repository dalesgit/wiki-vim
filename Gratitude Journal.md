## Wed 18 Sep 2024 
I feel a relief with the stump of the tree ground up. One giant step taken.

My colonoscopy upcoming. Then the trip to Colorado.
## Tue 17 Sep 2024 
- For the lectio reading last night -- the paraphrase of Psalm 137. Cf. notes in Joplin
- Giant tree is gone. All that's left is the stump. That stump is reminiscent of *The Giving Tree*. Also **Elijah's chair**. Musical chairs. 
## Fri 13 Sep 2024 

- The opportunity to be a part of the SD class. 
- The cartoon to send to Owen about sons doing the opposite of their fathers.
## Thu 12 Sep 2024  

Food to eat. Expectation of seeing Julian soon.
## Wed 11 Sep 2024 
- Again I got up only once in the night. 
- The 30 minutes at the pool yesterday
- The notes and reading I accomplished re. [spiritual direction.md](spiritual direction.md)
- delicious salmon dinner
## Tue 10 Sep 2024  
- Nothing on the calendar.
- the ease with which my slicer cut through celery (and others)
- note-taking on Guenther [spiritual direction.md](spiritual direction.md)
-
## Mon 09 Sep 2024 
- For today's lectio. For the mp3 player I may start working with.
- *Peace like a River*, Leif Enger. novel recommended by Peter. MP read it. She loved its writing, including a vision of near death experience. Sounded like first time I read *Perelandra*.
## Sun 08 Sep 2024 
I was sleeping so soundly when I woke up and then I felt weary. I don't look forward to celebrating and then facilitating discussion. But grateful that I have a place and a role that contributes in some ways to people's lives. I felt energized last night. I recognized that when I celebrate I give it my all, even for fewer than 20.
## Sat 07 Sep 2024 
- fresh coffee in the morning
- wordle seemed challenging the last 2 days, but I got them
- celebrated Mass. Connected with Richard (of Carol) in the back.
- Tricia is going to study the liturgy. I recommended that she google "instructed Eucharist".
## Fri 06 Sep 2024 
- Moving forward with [MP.md](MP.md) going to gym (or back into therapy)
## Thu 05 Sep 2024 
- that EJI reminds me of the injustices perpetrated in my "west" e.g. against Chinese
- at the gym I did Spinning with my hand slung off of the machine. Kalani's guess about what caused the **spikes** is **not** correct.
##  Wed 04 Sep 2024 
- It feels like lots of normal results from the cardiac testing.
- writing notes on Guenther (SD)
## Tue 03 Sep 2024 03:16:53 PM EDT 
[cardiology](cardiology.md): I have isolated some of the clue about my spiking heart rate when "spinning" at gym. I don't yet know if it has to do with the spinning

Today I did the Spinning first. I got a spike, but I quickly tried to pull back the intensity. I only had one. But evidently it is the "Spinning" that initiates the episode.
