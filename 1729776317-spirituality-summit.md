### **Living with an Open Heart: A Sufi Approach to Suffering with Omid Safi**

How do we respond to a world full of suffering and injustice while staying connected to love? Join Sufi scholar Omid Safi to explore the deep spiritual call to share in our common humanity and confront the pain and polarization around us. Omid challenges us to examine our biases—who do we believe is sacred?—and to recognize the interconnectedness of all life. We’ll discuss the role of sacred rage, the balance between contemplation and action, and how prayer alone is not enough. Omid also offers profound insights on personal suffering, showing us how witnessing, silence, and gentleness can transform our pain into deeper love. Whether you’re on the frontlines of justice or navigating your own trials, this conversation will inspire you to engage the world with both heart and courage.

- Lives in American South. White man, younger than he, calls him "boy". Accompanied with assumptions.
- Islam: "Paradise is a **walled garden**"
- "Rage" can be warranted. Some things: "If you're not angry about it you're not really alive."
- Not just "thoughts and prayers" with no action is nothing.
- Prophet teaches: "How do you help the oppressor?" Answ: "You stop him."

### Cynthia Winton-Henry _Contemplative Embodiment: Coming Home to Body and Soul_

Contemplative Embodiment: Coming Home to Body and Soul
with Cynthia Winton-Henry

Join us for a gentle and nourishing body practice that invites you to reconnect with your whole self. Through Cynthia's guidance, you’ll explore organic movement, voice, words, and the stillness in ourselves, others, and the world. With easy focus and gentle releasing, we’ll attend to the physicality of grace and build on it as we dance on behalf of one another and the world.

### Radical Welcome: Ignatian Spirituality & Queer Christians _James Martin_

What does it mean to extend love and welcome to those who feel most excluded, especially within a Church that has often been a source of pain?

In this conversation with Fr. James Martin, we’ll explore how spirituality can be more inclusive, especially for those who feel alienated by traditional religion. We’ll dive into the wisdom of Ignatian spirituality, discovering how it offers tools for seekers both inside and outside the Church, and why the story of Lazarus offers profound lessons about letting go and new beginnings.

Fr. Jim will also share insights from his experience in Pope Francis' Synod and his vision for a Church that embraces vulnerability and compassion, even in the face of resistance. How can we create spiritual spaces that welcome everyone? What does it mean to "come forth" into a new way of being?

This conversation is for anyone seeking hope, healing, and a more open-hearted way of connecting with the divine in a divided world.

#### LGBTQ people

Reading Bible needs to be contextualized. In our current age **hate** seems to be more common -- even normalized.

He says that Francis meets with transgender people ("all the time") and in other ways is open. He's first Pope, leader?, to use the word "gay".

He sees the Zacchaeus story as a parable for church attitude toward LGBTQ. Who are the outcast? Jesus invites to stay with him. Outreach to those on the margins. Even in the face of people grumbling.

"What keeps you in the church?" he was asked. Promises. Baptism. "Not everyone can like you." an insight. He has the support of Francis. Practically speaking he doesn't look at all the criticism, avoiding some of it. Try to never go against church teaching. Be humble. Self-examination.

"The creator can communicate with the creature through his creation."

Belong to a community in order to **Connect** and **Correct**. e.g. is alone I decide that I won't help homeless people because it's their fault. The community corrects that notion. e.g. recommend: Faith share group.

> Maybe I need to get a group that is mine.

Joan Chittester: If you're going to leave the church don't leave quietly. If you're going to stay, don't stay quietly.

#### Synod?

- he was asked to be a part of. Make the church a more listening church.
- need to listen to voices that we don't usually listen to: especially lay people and women.
