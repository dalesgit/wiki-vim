How characterize book. Meeting those who have left institutional church. God is not to be found out there somewhere distant, but in the world around us. People spiritual vs. religious. Notie practices: good practices and some not so good.

Joe recognizing that some Christians are actually showing up to show Jesus's love and acceptance.

Lots of energy in the group. Pent up. 

Both. Hyper connected and hyper alienated.

I gasped audibly. If the church cannot mourn the deaths of all people, Christians and Muslims and Jews, friends and enemies, fellow citizens and strangers, the guilty and the innocent, what good is religion?

For years, the church kept me safe inside a building. All the while, the Spirit was out here on the streets.

definition, religion is inherently communal, rituals and relationships that weave a spiritual web of meaning and purpose in the world.

The real problem is that, in the last two centuries, religion has actually allowed itself to become privatized.

Highlight (yellow) - CHAPTER 7: Commons > Page 237

And, in the process, community became isolated behind the walls of buildings where worship experiences corresponded to members’ tastes and preferences and confirmed their political views.

We are either cursed or blessed on the basis of our relationships with others and how we care for the land. People prosper when justice reigns.

It is about tracing the threads of the interconnected universe, about finding God in nature and in community— and, in finding God, discovering that we really are one.

The commons, sometimes referred to in the singular as the common, is what we live for, the public world tribes make together— that serves the good for all.

“There’s always room for one more.”

In the center of most New England towns is the commons, a sizable community green space, owned by all, ringed by important public buildings and old homes, where early inhabitants could graze their livestock or plant shared gardens.

Highlight (yellow) - CHAPTER 7: Commons > Page 241

The commons was a visible geography of the inner spiritual reality of the village and the villagers hopes for the world, the very definition of what Christians refer to as a sacrament.

Highlight (yellow) - CHAPTER 7: Commons > Page 241

The commons is the geography of hospitality, belonging to none, welcoming all.

Empathy, like that poured out on September 11, is the binding ingredient of the world commons.

**Žižek claims that the big ideologies of the twentieth century— capitalism and Communism— tried to address worldwide issues, but both failed.**

**As King saw it, the human future was a choice between a global beloved community, a commons based on spiritual and moral revolution, and a planet in chaos.**

Instead, sports offer an alternative way to access communal spiritual awareness. Regular participation in religious services may or may not create communitas, but a heightened sense of communal oneness is a frequent occurrence in sporting events.

Highlight (yellow) - CHAPTER 7: Commons > Page 252

These sorts of gatherings are necessary for the world’s soul, mostly because they are egalitarian and playful, filled with collective joy. Perhaps the loss of communitas is one reason why we feel our societies have declined and the commons feels empty. We have forgotten to dance in the streets with strangers.

An ancient liturgy unfolded on the beach, complete with grains of sand along with the bread and wine that we fed to one another.

We were not taking Communion as much as we were communing— experiencing a deep spiritual connection with nature, our friends, and God.

“live in the world, seeing everything in it as a revelation of God.” 17

Communitas emerges when human beings gather, a collective sense of unity. Communion is the sort of sharing that results in a more profound sense of our relationships to each other and the world. And compassion insists that we have a moral responsibility for each other.

On the tarmac was a private car, dispatched by the airline to deliver him home. “Compassion” comes from the Latin word compassio, meaning “to pity, sympathize with, or suffer with,” and is related to the Greek word sympatheia, denoting “fellow feeling, community of feeling.”

Highlight (yellow) - CHAPTER 7: Commons > Page 259

When religion fails at compassion, it fails at its own test. To neglect loving your neighbor— to lack compassion— that is the problem underlying all other human problems.

Highlight (yellow) - CHAPTER 7: Commons > Page 260

The Charter for Compassion is a call created by religious leaders from around the world as a result of Armstrong’s dream.

But somehow, our leaders did not grasp the idea of reciprocity. Instead, they seized a political opportunity.

WHEN JESUS SAID, “LOVE YOUR ENEMIES,” HE PROBABLY DIDN’T MEAN “KILL THEM.”

“That it is precisely when we recognize our common humanity— when we recognize our own humanity in the face of the other— it is then that we also recognize the face of God.”
