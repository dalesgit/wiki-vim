# Concluding forum discussion on *Grounded*

> *I have included the discussion questions from the opening and the closing of the book. I have done this, because my sense of what is most relevant to finishing a book is to take stock of the over-arching intention of the author in this particular book. What is the overall intention of the author in writing the book? How did the author do? In discussions I have led in the past, there are 3 prompts that have yielded the richest discussion:*

1. What surprised you?
2. What did you learn?
3. What do you want to do about it?

## Introduction
1. Diana Butler Bass says that there is a spiritual revolution happening in which the question “**Who is God**?” has evolved into the question “**Where is God**?” (p. 6).  Have you seen or felt this change? Why does it matter?
2. Have you observed any of the changes Butler Bass points to? If so, in what ways does this book help you interpret these changes?
3. “To relocate God is to reground our lives” (p. 11).  **When you think of God, where do you assume God to be**? Where did that idea come from? How might “relocating God” reground your life? 
4. Butler Bass claims that today our experience of faith and meeting God is **coming down off the mountain**, meaning that we no longer find God only within the walls of the church. What are your thoughts about this?  If you attend church, does it change anything about that experience? If you don’t, how do you feel about faith being accessible around us, in the world and our neighbors?
### Revelation
1. Throughout the book, Butler Bass has demonstrated an awareness of the connections we share with God and others here on earth. “*What was once the vision of only a few has now become a theological revolution of many*” (p. 271). If you asked “nones” and “dones” about their lives and choices, do you think they would see themselves as part of a **spiritual revolution**? Why or why not?
2. “*The old God is fading from view. … And a new God has risen over the horizon*” (p. 277). After reading this book, what are your thoughts on that statement? How would you share that with friends, family, and people who consider themselves spiritual or part of a faith
community?
3. How does a church move from the past to the future while living in a constantly changing present?
4. Did the author accomplish her goals for you as a reader?  How have you become more grounded by reading this book? What, if anything, **surprised** you in these pages?  Was anything worrisome? Did anything **delight** you or give you **hope**? Explain.

|      |                | we dwell between the paradisial garden and the holy city. We live in the world as it is. And earth is, of course, not as it used to be.            |
