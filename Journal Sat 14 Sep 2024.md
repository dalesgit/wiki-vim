*Reflection for Spiritual Direction Course*

1. I notice…(awareness) that these prompts are very like the admonition in 1 Co 1 about the cross being the "wisdom of God". This is from today's **lectio**.
- I am aware that MP again and again dominated conversation at Lou and Elaine's tonight. Lou's difficulty with centering prayer was met from her with defense and justification for contemplative prayer. I wanted to pursue with him what worked for him.
2. I’m curious about… (attentive exploration) What is the relationship between [SD](SD.md) and "the power and wisdom of God" 
- What should I have done? Could I have?
3. I wonder how I can… (active response)
