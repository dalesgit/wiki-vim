-   **Chicken:** Boneless skinless chicken breasts or chicken thighs. You can even use separated frozen chicken breasts. Same cook time.
-   **White beans:** Use low sodium or no salt added canned beans like cannellini beans, navy beans or great Northern beans. You could also use pinto beans in a pinch.
-   **Corn:** Fresh, cooked, frozen (no need to thaw), or canned (drained) corn works.
-   **Veggies and fruit:** White onion or yellow onion, fresh cilantro and fresh lime juice.
-   **Broth:** Low sodium [chicken broth](https://ifoodreal.com/how-to-make-chicken-broth/), [Instant Pot chicken broth](https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-chicken-stock-bone-broth/), chicken stock, or [vegetable broth](https://ifoodreal.com/how-to-make-vegetable-broth/). I like to use organic bouillon cubes or chicken bouillon paste diluted with water.
-   **Diced green chilies:** From a 4 ounces can found in Mexican food aisle or shelf. You could use a minced jalapeno with seeds removed or salsa verde instead of canned green chilies.
-   **Spices:** Chili powder, garlic powder, ground cumin, salt, pepper.
-   **Dairy:** Greek yogurt or regular yogurt, and cream cheese.

## How to Make White Chicken Chili in Instant Pot

For this recipe you can use 6,8 or 10 quart [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/2Dw2qRs)! See Tips section for 3 quart pressure cooker.

**Step 1:** Add fresh chicken breasts or frozen ones whole and save yourself from washing another cutting board. Also add corn, onion, green chilies, beans and spices to Instant Pot.

We will make chili creamy and add fresh herbs after it is cooked. Dairy scorches under pressure, that’s why we don’t add it before.

**Step 2:** Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes and allow 10 minutes of [natural release](https://ifoodreal.com/how-to-natural-release-instant-pot/). Then turn pressure cooker valve to Venting position.

If you vent right away, stew will splatter all over your counters. Shred chicken, I like to do so right in Instant Pot with 2 forks.

**Step 3:** Add yogurt, cream cheese and herbs. You can use all yogurt, cream cheese or heavy cream. I like my proportions for balance of health and creaminess.

## Tips for Best Results

Here are a few tips for the best white chicken chili in Instant Pot experience.

-   **Don’t stir the ingredients:** After you add them to the pressure cooker. There is no need to and helps to avoid Burn. But if you stirred by accident, more likely it should be fine.
-   **To double the recipe:** To cook double the amount of chili in the pressure cooker, do so only in 8 quart or 10 quart pot Instant Pot. Make sure all ingredients do not exceed 2/3 max line before cooking. Pressure cooking time remains the same.
-   **For 3 quart Instant Pot:** Cut ingredients in half and keep same cook time.

## Variations

Make it less or more spicy for your crew, use different type of chicken, or use dried beans.

-   **Shredded chicken:** If you have leftovers, for example [Instant Pot shredded chicken](https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-shredded-chicken/), they would be perfect for this chili. Just cook as directed. Also Thanksgiving turkey leftovers would be great as well.
-   **Rotisserie chicken:** Add shredded rotisserie chicken including even bones, if you wish. I recommend to add salt at the end then because store-bought cooked chicken comes pre-seasoned.
-   **Using frozen chicken:** Truth is cooking [frozen chicken breasts in Instant Pot](https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-frozen-chicken-breast/) doesn’t require much more time. Just make sure chicken pieces are separated and cook for same time.
-   **Ground chicken:** To use it instead of whole chicken pieces, press Saute and wait until display says Hot. Then saute ground chicken, constantly stirring and breaking into pieces, until small pieces form. No need to cook through.
-   **Chicken thighs:** Cook as per recipe, whether they are bone-in or boneless.
-   **Dried beans:** For [dried beans](https://ifoodreal.com/how-to-cook-dried-beans/), use 1 cup rinsed (but unsoaked) dried white beans with 2 cups of chicken stock (total not extra), and cook chili for 35 minutes.
-   **Make it spicy:** At the end, add desired amount of chopped or sliced jalapeno pepper right to the pot.
-   **Lighten it up:** Omit cream cheese and mash a few white beans in a bowl, then return to the pot. It will become creamy naturally.
