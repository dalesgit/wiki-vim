## Prayer for healing 1
N., I lay my hands upon you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,  
**beseeching** our Lord Jesus Christ   
to **sustain** you with his presence,   
to **drive away** all sickness of body and spirit,  
and to give you that **victory of life and peace**  
which will **enable** you to serve him both now and evermore. Amen.

## Prayer for healing 2

â€¦ (as above)  
may our Lord Jesus Christ **comfort** you in your distress  
**sustain** you with his presence  
**drive away** all sickness of body and spirit  
and bring you to that place of **peace and quietness**  
that is our **hope's longing**.
