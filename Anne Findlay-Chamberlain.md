# Anne Findlay-Chamberlain
Woodstock VA. served Manoa church. Knew Jodene. Came to Charlotte from Hawaii. Therapist before ordination 10 yrs ago.
## intro
- "Ignatian" __holy is in everything__
- holy moments all over the place
- e.g. a woman who felt estranged from God, but experienced holiness in a dripping faucet
- "not a good conversationalist in gatherings"
- "What do you find joy in?" as a provocative question -- prompt
- While in Hawai'i, an older woman, seemed to be kind to a guy in praise band who always seemed lost. Said to her I noticed how kind you have been in various places"
- She also was a chaplain in Milwaukee
## Defining SD
- define SD: a series of conversations inviting other to notice -- become aware of the Spirit.
- in Hawaii learned term: "wayfinding" cf. Hokuleia.
    - get out past waves to get bearings (getting to know someone)
    - start paddling to find the way to go
    - voyaging: look for signs in the sky
    - she never has an agenda for "directee"
- doesn't do SD with parishioners (couldn't collect $ from parishioner)
    - like spiritual guerilla
    - what's happening to a person's affect, put hands in such and such â€¦
    - ask provocative questions (like a personality flaw)
## overlap pastor and SD
- overlap of pastor and SD
    - start "listening group" at church
    - start with a story (based on season) then asking prompts to the group.
        - How will we see Spirit in the way the congregation
        - Provide spiritual practices in these groups, e.g. sacred walks -- notice things in neighborhood. Centering prayer -- when people are so full of words. rather than, "here I am Lord"
        - integrate contemplative practices in the life of the congregation, e.g. silences. People responded, "I never saw the sky until you said 'look up'".
    - ring bell at a meeting, no one speaks until the sound ends. Even with children. Listen til the bell ends.
- she loves to write. A blog. e.g. filled with meditations (on some event). e.g. experience of spilled blueberries in the middle of Walmart. the response of clerks. After a while she **began inviting members of the congregation to contribute reflections**.
- Anything that leads a person to know that they're not alone.
- At end of pandemic, the listening groups became a center of pastoral care -- up to the present.
- Use anything. A yard sale. "I feel like I have a front row seat in what God is doing in people's lives."
### Any roles in which roles have been confused?
- cp. inviting people to share vs. __teaching__? (LS)
## further
- the lectionary study groups she calls **Sacred Seasons**
	- what stands out for you with e.g. *summer*. What about it was special for you?
- LS: share real time experience.
	- Someone who was resistant, crying for 6 months, ... "do no harm"
	- as pastor "pastoral counseling" limited by policy
- Anne: familiar separating what is the other's stuff and what is mine?
- both pastor and SD effectiveness is built on **trust**
- chaplain and SD "non-anxious presence"
	- Chaplain is time-limited
	- intensity is very different between the 2. Chaplains with someone at very intense moments of life.
- Anne might open with silence and other kinds of moves, questions, but she doesn't put prayer to the fore -- only if asked for. The act of listening is a prayer. 
- **prayer can be manipulative**
- (LS): We at center came out of the (now) Atrium chaplaincy system. Spirituality Center providing something to "process their stories".
	- Spirituality Center has
		- intake form (e.g. number of sessions, recommendations)
		- Companionship agreement
- Allison, Cherrie both trained to include prayer with ...
- Congregations have different cultures
- Nina: works with a Cambodian congregation. For them a **pastor** is everything. How comparmentalize?
	- LS: a problem-solving question, your SD hat is not going to be on. Promblem-solving is not SD. Help find own-answers.
## scenarios might bring to SD ... to Pastoring
- cf. screenshots
- normalizing the experience that's expressed is to convey acceptance
- break down words: e.g. sometimes lack of **trust** really means **grieving**
- look more at **what is** as opposed to **what isn't**
- from other reading: there's exterior experiences vs. interior experience -- this can be very affirming
