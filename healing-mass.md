# The Holy Eucharist: Rite One

## The Word of God -- (p. 323)

*Celebran*t: Blessed be God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  
_People_    And blessed be his kingdom, now and for ever. _Amen._

rest we shall be saved, in quietness and confidence shall be  
our strength: By the might of _thy_ Spirit lift us, we pray _thee_,  
to _thy_ presence, where we may be still and know that _thou  
art_ God; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen._

**Concluding Prayer**

Lord, make us instruments of your peace. Where there is  
hatred, let us sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where  
there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith; where  
there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where  
there is sadness, joy. Grant that we may not so much seek to  
be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand;  
to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is  
in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we  
are born to eternal life. _Amen._
