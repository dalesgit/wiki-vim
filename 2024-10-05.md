## Diary

-I have been disoriented. What's that about?

- Trying to track the problem with delay in typing in vim? I have tried unsetting timeout. It hasn't worked. It's like there's a delay when I stop typing. I'm thinking it has to do with the leader key being space bar. Yes, now that I've put it back to default ("\") things seem to be back to normal.
- The confusion will be that lazy-nvim defaults to space bar.
- Asking the question how to get rid of the line length warning (above) <<https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/discussions/2367>
