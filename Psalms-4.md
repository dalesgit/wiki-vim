### Psalm 101

I sing to you, my God, and live the truth I sing.
I sing to you, O Lord, sing your justice and love, and live the truth I sing.
When will you come to me?
I show my royal household how to lead a perfect life.
I shun what is devious and hate deceit - it can never touch me.
The wicked dare not approach me, for I am no friend to evil I silence those who gossip, I detest their vanity and pride.
I look for loyal people to share my palace.
Those who live honest lives will serve me.
I cannot bear scoundrels and liars, they are not welcome in my house.
My daily work
is to rid the land of evil and cleanse the City of God. D

### Psalm 144

I sing you a new song, Lord, I play my ten-stringed harp.
Praise God, God my rock who trains my hands for battle, my arms for war.
God, my love, my safety, my stronghold and defender, God, my shield, my refuge, you give me victory.
Who are we that you care for us?
Why give a thought to mortals?
We are little more than breath; our days, fleeting shadows.
Come, Lord, lower the heavens, touch the mountains, let them spew out smoke,
Strike lightning, let your arrows fly, scatter my enemies in terror.
Reach down from the heavens, snatch me from crashing waves;
rescue me from strangers who speak lies
and then swear to them.
I sing you a new song, Lord, I play my ten-stringed harp, for you give victory to kings, you rescue your servant, David.
Save me from the bitter sword, deliver me from strangers, who speak lies
and then swear to them.
God, you shape our sons like tall, sturdy plants; you sculpt our daughters like pillars for a palace.
You fill our barns with all kinds of food, you bless our fields with sheep by the thousands and fatten all our cattle.
There is no breach in the walls, no outcry in the streets, no exile.
We are a people blest with these gifts, blest with the Lord as our God!

### Psalm 137

By the rivers of Babylon we sat weeping;
on the poplars we hung our harps. 
By the rivers of Babylon we sat weeping, remembering Zion.
There on the poplars we hung our harps.
Our captors shouted for happy songs, for songs of festival.
"Sing!" they cried,
"the songs of Zion."
How could we sing the song of the Lord in a foreign land?
Jerusalem forgotten?
Wither my hand!
Jerusalem forgotten?
Silence my voice! if I do not seek you as my greatest joy.
Lord, never forget that crime of Edom against your city, the day they cried,
"Strip! Smash her to the ground!"
Doomed Babylon, be cursed!
Good for those who deal you evil for evil!
Good for those who destroy you, who smash your children at the walls.

### Psalm 138

I join heaven's chorus, praising your love and fidelity.
I thank you with all I am, I join heaven's chorus.
I bow toward your holy temple, to praise your name.
By your love and fidelity, you display to all
the glory of your name and promise.
As soon as I call, you act, renewing my strength.
Around the world, rulers praise you for your commanding word.
They sing of your ways,
"Great is your glory, Lord."
Though high up, you see the lowly; though far away,
you keep an eye on the proud.
When I face an opponent, you keep me alive.
You reach out your hand, your right hand saves me.
Lord, take up my cause, your love lasts for ever.
Do not abandon
what your hands have made. D

## Wednesday Morning Prayer

### Psalm 108

God, your love is boundless, stretching beyond the stars.
I have decided, O God, I will sing of your glory, will sing your praise.
Awake, my harp and lyre, so I can wake up the dawn.
I will lift my voice,
sing of you, Lord, to all nations.
For your love fills the heavens, your unfailing love, the sky.
O God, rise high above the heavens!
Spread your glory across the earth!
Deliver those you love,
use your strength to rescue me.
God decreed in the temple:
"I give away Shechem, parcel out Succoth.
Manasseh and Gilead are mine.
"With Ephraim as my helmet, and Judah my spear,
I will make Moab my wash bowl, trample Edom under my feet, and over Philistia shout in triumph."
Who will help me, Lord, scale the heights of Edom and breach the city wall?
God, will you keep holding back?
Will you desert our camp?
Stand by us against the enemy, all other aid is worthless.
With you the battle is ours, you will crush our foes. •

### Psalm 146

My whole life, give praise to God.
Praise the Lord, my heart!
My whole life, give praise.
Let me sing to God as long as I live.
Never depend on rulers: born of earth, they cannot save.
They die, they turn to dust.
That day, their plans crumble.
They are wise who depend on God, who look to Jacob's Lord, creator of heaven and earth, maker of the teeming sea.
The Lord keeps faith for ever, giving food to the hungry, justice to the poor, freedom to captives.
The Lord opens blind eyes and straightens the bent, comforting widows and orphans, protecting the stranger.
The Lord loves the just
but blocks the path of the wicked.
Zion, praise the Lord!
Your God reigns for ever, from generation to generation.
Hallelujah!o

### Psalm 139:1-12

Your wisdom overwhelms me, Lord: too much to understand!
You search me, Lord, and know me.
Wherever I sit or stand, you read my inmost thoughts;
whenever I walk or rest, you know where I have been.
Before a word slips from my tongue, Lord, you know what I will say.
You close in on me, pressing your hand upon me.
All this overwhelms me — too much to understand!
Where can I hide from you?
How can I escape your presence?
I scale the heavens, you are there!
I plunge to the depths, you are there!
If I fly toward the dawn, or settle across the sea,
even there you take hold of me, your right hand directs me.
If I think night will hide me and darkness give me cover, I find darkness is not dark.
For your night shines like day, darkness and light are one. o

### Psalm 139:13-24

Search my heart, probe me, God!
Lead me along your ancient way.
You created every part of me, knitting me in my mother's womb.
For such handiwork, I praise you.
Awesome this great wonder!
I see it so clearly!
You watched every bone taking shape in secret, forming in the hidden depths.
You saw my body grow according to your design.
You recorded all my days before they ever began.
How deep are your thoughts!
How vast their sum! like countless grains of sand, well beyond my grasp.
Lord, destroy the wicked, save me from killers.
They plot evil schemes, they blaspheme against you.
How I hate those who hate you!
How I detest those who defy you!
I hate with a deadly hate these enemies of mine.
Search my heart, probe me, God!
Test and judge my thoughts.
Look! do I follow crooked paths?
Lead me along your ancient way. •
