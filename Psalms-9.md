## Tuesday morning prayer

### Psalm 43

Send your light and truth, my God.
Decide in my favor, God, plead my case against the hateful, defend me from liars and thugs.
For you are God my fortress.
Why have you forgotten me?
Why am I bent double under the weight of enemies?
Send your light and truth.
They will escort me to the holy mountain where you make your home.
I will approach the altar of God, God, my highest joy,
and praise you with the harp, God, my God.
Why are you sad, my heart?
Why do you grieve?
Wait for the Lord.
I will yet praise God my savior. •

### Psalm 65

All praise is yours, God in Zion.
Praise is yours, God in Zion.
Now is the moment to keep our vow, for you, God, are listening.
All people come to you
bringing their shameful deeds.
You free us from guilt, from overwhelming sin.
Happy are those you invite and then welcome to your courts.
Fill us with the plenty of your house, the holiness of your temple.
You give victory
in answer to our prayer.
You inspire awe, God, our savior, hope of distant lands and waters.
Clothed in power, you steady the mountains; you still the roaring seas, restless waves, raging nations.
People everywhere
stand amazed at what you do, east and west shout for joy.
You tend and water the land.
How wonderful the harvest!
You fill your springs,
ready the seeds, prepare the grain.
You soak the furrows and level the ridges.
With softening rain
you bless the land with growth.
You crown the year with riches.
All you touch comes alive: untilled lands yield crops, hills are dressed in joy,
flocks clothe the pastures, valleys wrap themselves in grain.
They all shout for joy and break into song.
## Tuesday evening prayer

### Psalm 49:2-13

We cannot save ourselves, but God will rescue us.
Everyone, take heed, all the world, listen, high and low, rich and poor alike.
I have wisdom you need to hear.
I see to the heart of things.
I tune my ear to the truth and set my insight to music.
Why should I be afraid in bad times when enemies surround me, disdainful in their power, arrogant in their wealth?
We cannot save ourselves, cannot set things right with God; the price is too high, well beyond our means.
There is no escaping death, no avoiding the grave.
Look, even the wisest die.
Fools and idiots perish with them, and others claim their wealth.
The grave is the only home where they settle for good, even if their land still bears their name.
No matter how great, no one sees the truth: we die like beasts. •

### Psalm 49:14-21

I know God will rescue me
and save me from the grip of death.
Here is the fate of those
only concerned for themselves: they go straight to Sheol.
Death shepherds them right into the grave, where flesh is eaten up and earth consumes them.
But I know God will rescue me, save me from the grip of death.
Do not worry about wealth, when someone else becomes rich.
You cannot take it to your grave, wealth is worth nothing in death.
No matter how wealthy, no matter how many tell you,
"My, how well you have done," the rich all join the dead never to see light again.
No matter how great, no one sees the truth: we die like beasts. •

## Wednesday morning prayer

### Psalm 77

God, you alone are holy.
What god compares to you?
I cry to you, God! I plead with you!
If only you would hear me!
By day I seek you in my distress, by night I raise my hands in prayer, but my spirit refuses comfort.
I groan when I remember you; when I think of you, I grow faint.
You keep me from sleep.
Troubled, I cannot speak.
I consider former days, the years gone by;
all night, memories fill my heart, I brood and question.
Will God always reject me?
Never again be pleased?
Has God stopped loving me and cut me off for ever?
Can God forget to pity, can anger block God's mercy?
It troubles me to think the Almighty has grown weak.
I recall your awesome deeds, your wonders of old.
I reflect on all you have done, on all your works.
You alone are holy.
What god compares to you?
You are the God of power, strong among the nations.
You reached out to save your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph.
Seeing you, the waters churned, shuddering, writhing, convulsed to the depths.
Clouds poured down rain, thunder shook the heavens, lightning darted like arrows.
And the thunder rolled, flashes lit up the world, the earth trembled and quaked.
You set a path through the sea, a way through raging waters, with no trace of your footprints.
You led your flock under Moses and Aaron. •

### Psalm 97

The Lord rules:
joy touches distant lands.
The Lord rules: the earth is eager, joy touches distant lands.
God is wrapped in thunder cloud, throned on justice, throned on right.
Fire marches out in front and burns up all resistance.
Overhead, God's lightning flares, the earth shudders to see it.
Mountains melt down like wax before the Lord, the ruler of all.
Overhead God's justice resounds, a glory all people can see.
Idolators are the fools, they brag of empty gods.
You gods, be subject to the Lord!
Zion hears, and is happy.
The cities of Judah are joyful about your judgments, Lord.
You, Lord, you reach high in majesty above the earth, far higher than any god.
Those who love the Lord hate evil;
God shields their faithful lives and breaks the hold of the wicked.
Light will rain down on the just, joy on the loyal heart.
Be joyous in the Lord God, you people of faith, praise God's holy name! •
## Wednesday evening prayer

### Psalm 62

Wait, my soul, silent for God, for God alone, my hope.
My soul waits, silent for God, for God alone, my salvation, alone my rock, my safety, my refuge: I stand secure.
How long will some of you attack tearing others down as if walls or fences on the verge of collapse?
You scheme to topple them, so smug in your lies; your lips are all blessing, but murder fills your heart.
Wait, my soul, silent for God, for God alone, my hope, alone my rock, my safety, my refuge: I stand secure.
God is my glory and safety, my stronghold, my haven.
People, give your hearts to God, trust always! God is our haven.
Mortals are but a breath, nothing more than a mirage; set them on the scales, they prove lighter than mist.
Avoid extortion and fraud, the hopes they breed are nothing; and if you should grow rich, place no trust in wealth.
Time and again God said,
"Strength and love are mine to give."
The Lord repays us all in light of what we do.

### Psalm 67

Favor and bless us, Lord.
Let your face shine on us.
Favor and bless us, Lord.
Let your face shine on us, revealing your way to all peoples, salvation the world over.
Let nations sing your praise, every nation on earth.
The world will shout for joy, for you rule the planet with justice.
In fairness you govern the nations and guide the peoples of earth.
Let the nations sing your praise, every nation on earth.
The land delivers its harvest, God, our God, has blessed us.
O God, continue your blessing, may the whole world worship you. D
