## question posed to [Linda](Linda.md) 
Tue 2024-07-23 22:53:10-0400

I posed your question, Peter, to my spiritual director this afternoon. She had several quick comments and 2 book suggestions. 

- Her first response when I read the question to her was, "The first thing we have to do is figure out what this thing *prayer* is that we're talking about. 
- She went on to say that in her mind, **prayer** is primarily about a relationship and that one of the essential things about a relationship is that there has to be self-knowledge, self-awareness, on our side of the relationship.
- She then noted that in any sort of relationship, there are an impossibly large number of things that can contribute to the relationship/friendship.

Two texts came to her as she was kind of thinking out loud.

1. *The Holy Longing; the search for a Christian spirituality* by Ronald Rolheiser 
2. *The Cup of Our Life: A Guide to Spiritual Growth* by Joyce Rupp

As for myself I know the work of both authors, but not these particular books. I'm going to buy both of them.
