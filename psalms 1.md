## SUNDAY EVENING PRAYER I 

### psalm 113

Praise the Lord's name here and in every place, from east to west.

Servants of God, praise, praise the name of the Lord.

Bless the Lord's name now and always.

Praise the Lord's name here and in every place, from east to west.

The Lord towers above nations,

God's glory shines over the heavens.

Who compares to our God?

Who is enthroned so high?

The Lord bends down to see heaven and earth, to raise the weak from the dust and lift the poor from the mire, to seat them with princes in the company of their leaders.

The childless, no longer alone, rejoice now in many children.

Hallelujah! •

I raise the cup of freedom as I call on God's name.

I believe, even as I say,

"I am afflicted."

I believe, even though I scream,

"Everyone lies!"

What gift can ever repay

God's gift to me?

I raise the cup of freedom as I call on God's name!

I fulfill my vows to you, Lord, standing before your assembly.

Lord, you hate to see your faithful ones die.

I beg you, Lord, hear me: it is 1, the servant you love, 1, the child of your servant.

You freed me from death's grip.

I bring a gift of thanks, as I call on your name.

I fulfill my vows to you, Lord, standing before your assembly, in the courts of your house, within the heart of Jerusalem.

Hallelujah! •

## SUNDAY MORNING PRAYER I. 

### Psalm 93

High above ocean breakers, you, God, rise with might.

Lord, you reign with glory, draped in splendor, girt with power.

The world stands firm, not to be shaken, for your throne, ageless God, has stood from of old.

Onward roll the waves, O God, onward like thunder, onward like fury.

Thundering above the waters, high above ocean breakers, you, God, rise with might.

Your decrees stand unshaken;

the beauty of holiness fills you for ever, Lord. O

The world stands firm, not to be shaken, for your throne, ageless God, has stood from of old.

Onward roll the waves, O God, onward like thunder, onward like fury.

Thundering above the waters, high above ocean breakers, you, God, rise with might.

Your decrees stand unshaken;

the beauty of holiness fills you for ever, Lord. •

### Palm 148

Across the heavens, from the heights, sing praise, sing praise!

Praise the Lord!

Across the heavens, from the heights,

all you angels, heavenly beings, sing praise, sing praise!

Sun and moon, glittering stars, sing praise, sing praise.

Highest heavens, rain clouds, sing praise, sing praise.

Praise God's name,

whose word called you forth and fixed you in place for ever by eternal decree.

Let there be praise: from depths of the earth, from creatures of the deep.

Fire and hail, snow and mist, storms, winds, mountains, hills, fruit trees and cedars, wild beasts and tame, snakes and birds,

princes, judges, rulers, subjects, men, women, old and young,

praise, praise the holy name, this name beyond all names.

God's splendor above the earth, above the heavens,

gives strength to the nation, glory to the faithful, a people close to the Lord Israel, let there be praise! •

## Evening prayer 2 

### Psalm 110


The Lord decrees to the king:

Take the throne at my right hand, hallelujah.

The Lord decrees to the king:

"Take the throne at my right hand, I will make your enemies a footrest.

I will raise your scepter over Zion and beyond, over all your enemies.

"Your people stand behind you on the day you take command.

You are made holy, splendid, newborn like the dawn, fresh like the dew."

God's oath is firm:

"You are a priest for ever, the rightful king by my decree." The Lord stands at your side to destroy kings on the day of wrath.

God executes judgment, crushes the heads of nations, and brings carnage worldwide.

The victor drinks from a wayside stream and rises refreshed. •

###Psalm 111

Who can forget God's wonders, a God, merciful and kind! hallelujah!

With my whole heart

I praise the Lord among the just.

Great are God's works, a delight to explore.

In splendor, in majesty, God's justice will stand.

Who can forget God's wonders! a God, merciful and kind who nourished the faithful, upheld the covenant, and revealed mighty deeds, giving them the land of pagans.

Faithful, just, and true are all God's decrees: each law in its place, valid for ever.

The Lord redeems the faithful, decrees a lasting covenant.

Holy and awesome God's name!

Fear of the Lord is wisdom's crown, wise are those who live by it.

Praise the Lord for ever! D

## Monday morning prayer

### Psalm 84

To live with you is joy, Lord of heaven's might.

Your temple is my joy, Lord of heaven's might.

I am eager for it, eager for the courts of God.

My flesh, my flesh sings its joy to the living God.

As a sparrow homing, a swallow seeking a nest to hatch its young,

I am eager for your altars, Lord of heaven's might, my king, my God.

To live with you is joy, to praise you and never stop.

Those you bless with courage will bless you from their hearts.

When they cross the Valley of Thirst the ground is spaced with springs, with the welcome rain of autumn.

They travel the towns to reach the God of gods in Zion.

Hear me, Lord of might, heed me, God of Jacob.

God our shield, look,

see the face of your anointed.

One day within your courts is worth a thousand without.

I would rather stand at God's gate than move among the wicked.

God is our sun, our shield, the giver of honor and grace.

The Lord never fails to bless those who walk with integrity.

Lord of heaven's might, blest are all who trust in you.

Sing and bless God's name, tell God's triumph day to day.

A new song for the Lord!

Sing it and bless God's name, everyone, everywhere!

Tell the whole world

God's triumph day to day, God's glory, God's wonder.

A noble God deserving praise, the dread of other gods, the puny gods of pagans; for our God made the heavens - the Lord of majestic light who fills the temple with beauty.

Proclaim the Lord, you nations, praise the glory of God's power, praise the glory of God's name!

Bring gifts to the temple, bow down, all the earth, tremble in God's holy presence.

Tell the nations, "The Lord rules!"

As the firm earth is not swayed, nothing can sway God's judgment.

Let heaven and earth be glad, the sea and sea creatures roar, the field and its beasts exult.

Then let the trees of the forest sing before the coming of the Lord, who comes to judge the nations, to set the earth aright, restoring the world to order. •

## Evening prayer 

### psalm 123

Our help is the Lord
Creator of earth and sky

Say it, Israel!

If the Lord had not been with us, if the Lord had not been for us when enemies rose against us, they would have swallowed us in their blazing anger, and the raging waters

would have swept us away - rushing, surging water, thundering over us.

Blessed be the Lord

for saving our flesh from their teeth, for tearing the trapper's net, so we could flutter away like birds.

Our help is the Lord, creator of earth and sky.

## Tuesday morning prayer

### Psalm 85


Justice clears God's path, justice points the way.

Lord, you loved your land, brought Jacob back, forgot our guilt, forgave our sins, swallowed your anger, your blazing anger.

Bring us back, saving God.

End your wrath.

Will it stop,

or drag on for ever?

Turn, revive us, nourish our joy.

Show us mercy, save us, Lord!

I listen to God speaking:

"I, the Lord, speak peace, peace to my faithful people who turn their hearts to me." Salvation is coming near, glory is filling our land.

Love and fidelity embrace, peace and justice kiss.

Fidelity sprouts from the earth, justice leans down from heaven.

The Lord pours out riches, our land springs to life.

Justice clears God's path, justice points the way.

### Psalm 67

Lord, let your face shine on us, revealing your way to all peoples.

Favor and bless us, Lord.

Let your face shine on us, revealing your way to all peoples, salvation the world over.

Let nations sing your praise, every nation on earth.

The world will shout for joy, for you rule the planet with justice.

In fairness you govern the nations and guide the peoples of earth.

Let the nations sing your praise, every nation on earth.

The land delivers its harvest, God, our God, has blessed us.

O God, continue your blessing, may the whole world worship you.

## Tuesday evening prayer

### Psalm 125


As mountains circle Jerusalem, Lord, you embrace your people.

Those who trust the Lord stand firm as Zion, solid and strong.

As mountains circle Jerusalem, Lord, you embrace your people now and for ever.

Keep the rule of the wicked far from the land of the just, or the just may turn to evil.

Lord, show your goodness to those who do good, whose hearts are true.

Away with the devious, banish them with the wicked!

Give Israel peace! •

### Psalm 131

My smile being odds at rest in you, my God. 

Lord, I am not proud, holding my head too high, reaching beyond my grasp.

No, I am calm and tranquil like a weaned child resting in its mother's arms: my whole being at rest.

Let Israel rest in the Lord, now and for ever. •
