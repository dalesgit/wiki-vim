## 2024 fall / winter

- We will pay less than is needed on AC in order to get the $4,000 per month to Cruise
- That should leave enough in the checking (ca. $15,000) to pay the shortfall. After November we can schedule to pay off AC
- It's not clear yet how to pay for Charlotte Spirituality Center course, but perhaps flexible enough to cover.
- She is not going to get notifications for use of AE where card was not present.

We have 2 budgets to compare:
1. mine from Kmymoney
2. MP's from her spreadsheet and head
