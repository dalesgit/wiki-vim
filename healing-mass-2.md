### Psalm 71:1-14
*In te, Domine, speravi*

*The Reader will read each verse up to the asterisk. The People will respond with what follows the asterisk.*

1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge; *\
let me never be ashamed.

2 In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *\
incline your ear to me and save me.

3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *\
you are my crag and my stronghold.

4 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *\
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.

5 For you are my hope, O Lord God, *\
my confidence since I was young.

6 I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;\
from my mother's womb you have been my strength; *\
my praise shall be always of you.

7 I have become a portent to many; *\
but you are my refuge and my strength.

**Concluding Prayer**

Lord, make us instruments of your peace. Where there is hatred, let us sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is discord, union; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy. Grant that we may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.Â _Amen._
