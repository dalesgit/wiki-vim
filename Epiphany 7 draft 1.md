Where do we get our authority?

Where do we spend our money?

The percentages, of course, are different between the ordinary 80% and the wealthiest 20%.

Middle class: 33% housing, 17% transportation, 13% food, insurance and pensions 13%

cf. https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/12475/math-calculations-in-vim on how to use vim as calculator (insert mode). ctl r -- = 17+ [[etc.md|etc]]
76% is the total of above.

Michael Ramsey weekend on "authority in Gospel of gospels." “By what authority do you do these things?” Jesus asked repeatedly in the synaptic gospels.

re. John: ABSTRACT

This article examines Jesus' authority and influence in the Gospel of John and shows that Jesus' style of leadership is exemplary or prototypical rather than autocratic. Jesus' programme is 'to testify to the truth', that is, to proclaim the divine reality to the world. He uses influence (education and personal example) rather than authority (commands) to urge his disciples to continue his programme, so that people may believe and partake in a life-giving relationship with the Father and Son. This leadership style would be useful for contemporary models of leadership. https://scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2305-445X2016000100012#:~:text=There%20are%20several%20indications%20in,behalf%20(3%3A34).

With the advent of the ubiquity of media, especially the internet, it's quite easy for anybody to look and sound like an authority. 

## monk and warrior

During the civil wars in feudal Japan, an invading army would quickly sweep into a town and take control. In one particular village, everyone fled just before the army arrived - everyone except the Zen monk. Curious about this old fellow, the general went to the temple to see for himself what kind of man this monk was. When he wasn't treated with the deference and submissiveness to which he was accustomed, the general burst into anger. "You fool," he shouted as he reached for his sword, "don't you realize you are standing before a man who could run you through without blinking an eye!" But despite the threat, the master seemed unmoved. "And do you realize," the master replied calmly, "that you are standing before a man who can be run through without blinking an eye?"

This is an old Japanese Zen story. https://www.reddit.com/r/ramdass/comments/qrn0tz/im_trying_to_remember_a_story_about_a_monk_and_a/
