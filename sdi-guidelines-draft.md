## Guidelines for Ethical Conduct

### _For Reflection_

Spiritual Directors International recognizes that cultural and environmental factors may require these guidelines to be contextualized for different types of spiritual direction experiences. _Spiritual Directors International_ encourages individuals, formation and training programs, religious institutions, health care systems, spirituality centers, supervision circles, and peer groups to review and reappropriate these guidelines. To facilitate dialogue and re-appropriation of these guidelines, Spiritual Directors International offers these questions for reflection:

- How do you and your community define terms such as “spiritual direction,” “formation,” and “supervision”?
- How do you and your community understand potential difficulties associated with “multiple roles and relationships,” “imbalance of power,” “boundaries,” and“confidentiality”?
- How might the various guidelines contribute to the authenticity of your ministry and service of spiritual direction? Your community's ministry and service of spiritual direction?
- How might you adapt these guidelines in your particular cultural or organizational setting?
- What ethical concerns in spiritual direction do you and your community foresee that these guidelines do not address?
