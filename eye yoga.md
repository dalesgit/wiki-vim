In our digital age, where we're glued to screens for hours on end, eye health has become a growing concern. But a centuries-old practice is proving to be a powerful antidote to the strains of modern life.

Sneered at by sceptics, eye yoga is quickly becoming the must-try workout for anyone wanting to ditch their glasses for good. Dubbed the "workout for your eyes," this ancient practice is backed by shocking scientific evidence that it can dramatically improve your eyesight.

Eye yoga, a subset of the ancient Indian practice of yoga, involves a series of gentle eye exercises and techniques designed to strengthen the eye muscles, improve focus, and reduce eyestrain.

Studies have shown that regular eye yoga practice can lead to measurable improvements in nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism, allowing many people to reduce their dependence on glasses or contact lenses.

But the benefits don't stop there. Eye yoga has also been shown to relieve chronic eye strain, reduce headaches, and even enhance focus and concentration.

Experts say the key is the intense focus and controlled breathing required in eye yoga, which triggers the parasympathetic nervous system and puts the body into a state of deep relaxation.

Yoga expert Jess Parkinson appeared on This Morning this week to give viewers a step-by-step guide on how to properly perform the eye yoga poses and movements.

Jess explained to [ITV](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/itv) presenters Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard how simple but beneficial the exercises are before giving them a demonstration.

Expertsâ€™ eye yoga exercises:

1.  Figure-eight: Jess instructed the presenters and viewers at home to gently move their eyes in a figure-eight motion, first clockwise and then anticlockwise. This exercise is said to help improve eye muscle flexibility and coordination.
2.  Palming: Viewers were shown how to place the palms of their hands over their closed eyes, creating a dark, soothing environment. This exercise is intended to relax the eyes and reduce eye strain.
3.  Focus Shifting: Jess demonstrated shifting focus between near and far objects, first holding her thumb close to her face and then extending it out. This exercise is designed to improve the eyes' ability to adapt to changing focal distances.
4.  Peripheral Vision Expansion: Viewers were guided through an exercise where they slowly move their gaze from side to side, focusing on the peripherals. This is said to help enhance peripheral vision and improve overall visual awareness.
5.  Blinking Exercise: Jess guided viewers through a series of slow, intentional blinks to help lubricate the eyes and reduce dryness.

The scientific evidence on the benefits of eye yoga is nothing short of eye-opening.

Perhaps most impressively, eye yoga may even play a role in slowing the natural age-related decline in visual function. Studies suggest that regularly practising these specialised eye exercises can help maintain oculomotor control and delay the onset of conditions like presbyopia (age-related farsightedness).

So if you're looking to ditch the specs, relieve eye fatigue, or simply keep your peepers in tip-top shape, it may be time to roll out the yoga mat and give eye yoga a try. Your eyes will thank you.
