“It was a pleasure to have dinner the other night with Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada,” President Donald Trump [posted last month on Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113626786987358864). “I look forward to seeing the Governor again soon so that we may continue our in depth talks on Tariffs and Trade, the results of which will be truly spectacular for all! DJT.”

The taunting post was just one in a recent string of comments from Trump suggesting that the United States annex Canada and make it the 51st U.S. state. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted an unambiguous response on X: “There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.”

Of course, Trudeau is right. But there’s more to Trump’s jibing — and his expansionist rhetoric about buying Greenland or reclaiming the Panama Canal — than geopolitical swagger. History suggests the issue is not so much Canada, as dueling visions of what makes America great.

Trump, after all, is not the first president to entertain fever dreams of conquering our neighbor to the north. Credible presidents and statesmen articulated the same aspirations throughout the early 19th century. At issue was not Canada, *per se*, but whether the U.S. should grow over space, expanding its geographic territory, or over time, investing in its infrastructure and industries to accelerate progress. It became a defining divide between the Whig and Democratic parties in the antebellum era, and in some fashion, appears to have reemerged as a lens through which we can understand the Democratic and Republican parties today.

**America’s hunger for Canada** goes back to before the founding of the U.S. itself. Canada, of course, originated as one part of British North America, similar to the 13 colonies that eventually rebelled and formed the United States. Canada did not join those colonies in their rebellion due to cultural, political and strategic factors.

After Britain took control of Canada from France in 1763 following the Seven Years’ War, it enacted the Quebec Act of 1774 to secure the loyalty of French-speaking inhabitants by granting them religious and legal freedoms. While American revolutionary leaders such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin hoped that parts of Canada, especially Quebec and Nova Scotia, might join the revolution, these hopes were largely unmet. The Continental Army launched an invasion of Quebec in 1775, aiming to rally support from French Canadians. However, the campaign ended in defeat due to harsh winter conditions, logistical challenges and the population’s reluctance to support the largely Protestant rebellion.

In Nova Scotia, which had economic ties to New England, strong British military control and local Loyalist sentiment prevented any significant revolutionary movement. The Continental Congress also attempted to persuade Canadians diplomatically but failed to sway public opinion.

After the Revolution, the British maintained a firm grip on Canadian territories through strategic military presence and policies that appeased the local population, which continued to prefer British rule over the uncertainty of American governance. The War of 1812, which in a theoretical world might have led to Canadian annexation, instead, solidified Canada’s separate identity and reinforced its population’s loyalty to the British Crown. This affinity for London over Washington, D.C. persisted as Canada developed its own institutions and governance, culminating in the creation of Canada as a self-governing dominion in 1867.

None of this prevented American statesmen from dreaming. As early as George Washington, who in 1775 expected that Canada would fall like “easy prey,” U.S. leaders cast an acquisitive eye northward. During the War of 1812, Henry Clay assured President James Madison that “the militia of Kentucky are alone competent to place Upper Canada at your feet.” Former President Thomas Jefferson [echoed this sentiment](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-05-02-0231), eagerly anticipating that “the acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching; & will give us experience for the attack of Halifax the next, & the final expulsion of England from the American continent.”

John Quincy Adams, who served as James Monroe’s Secretary of State and subsequently as president, harbored interest in annexing Canada as early as 1811, when he envisioned U.S. dominion over the entire continent, “one nation, speaking one language, professing one general system of religious and political principles, and accustomed to one general tenor of social usage and customs.” In 1822, while in Monroe’s cabinet, he affirmed that the “world should become familiarized with the idea of considering our proper dominion to be the entire continent of North America,” by which he meant both Canadian and Mexican annexation.

While some hawks retained these dreams as late as the 1830s and 1840s, when it seemed plausible that uprisings in Canada and Mexico might destabilize both nations and make them ripe for the picking, mainstream attention gradually shifted west and South, as Manifest Destiny came to embrace a vision of America’s presence from the Atlantic to the Pacific, including the present day Southwest — but ending at the fixed northern border between the U.S. and British North America.

**As is likely the case today,** in the 19th century, the impulse to fold Canada into the growing United States may have been less about Canada, *per se*, and more about dueling ideas about American greatness. This difference became especially pronounced by the 1830s, when a growing divide between Andrew Jackson’s Democratic party and the opposition Whig party came to define the American political debate.

During the antebellum period, the rift between the Whigs and Democrats over national policy can be understood through the framework of expansion over “space” versus expansion over “time.” It’s a framework that historians later imposed, and not rooted in contemporary political discourse of the time. But it’s a helpful lens for understanding how the parties envisioned American expansion.

The Democrats were the party of space. They prioritized territorial expansion, believing that national strength and prosperity lay in acquiring new lands across North America. This perspective, often associated with the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, viewed the expansion of agricultural lands, particularly for white Southern slaveholders and Western settlers, as essential to maintaining economic and political stability. According to conventional thinking, land acquisition would ensure the perpetuation of a land-owning, self-sufficient and politically independent white yeomanry.

Democrats, particularly in the South and West, pushed for policies that facilitated westward expansion, such as the annexation of Texas (1845), the Oregon boundary settlement, which established the 49th parallel as the official boundary between the U.S. and Canada (1846), and the war with Mexico (1846-1848), which added vast new territories to the nation. They saw expansion as a means of providing economic opportunities for white settlers, often at the expense of Native Americans and indigenous Mexican residents.

By contrast, the Whig Party believed that national progress should come through expansion over time — focusing on internal economic development rather than territorial expansion. Taking their cue from Henry Clay, who dubbed his policy program the American System, Whigs argued that the U.S. should consolidate its existing territories by investing in infrastructure (roads, bridges, railroads and, eventually, a telegraph system), education and industrial growth to create a more unified and economically self-sufficient nation. By reducing the amount of time needed to transmit capital, labor and ideas, these investments would actually collapse space and bind the already geographically disparate nation together in a web of common culture, interests and outlook.

These two visions of American greatness were not without contradiction. During the Mexican American War, most Northern Whigs, including then-Congressman Abraham Lincoln, staunchly opposed the Polk administration’s policy of conquest and annexation, but many Southern Whigs favored it, perceiving an opportunity to expand slavery into new southwest territories. During the Civil War, the governing Republican party — top-heavy with ex-Whigs like Lincoln — pursued vast railroad construction that ultimately opened the far-flung West to white settlement and resource extraction, thereby ensuring the conquest of Native American populations and *de facto* expansion of the nation across space.

But these two ideals — one focused on land, one on perfection — embodied the prevailing debate in the decades before the Civil War. And in some ways, it defines political debates today.

**Democrats and Republicans** have long debated the extent to which government should invest in education, infrastructure and commerce. In a 21st-century context, that means federal funding for schools and universities; the construction of highways, wind and solar energy facilities and rural broadband; and support for industry, including nascent green energy sectors like electric vehicles. On a base level, Democrats are the inheritors of Henry Clay’s and Abraham Lincoln’s Whig party. They eagerly embrace and promote an idea of American greatness that rests on the quality of the nation’s human and physical capital, rather than the quantity of its land mass.

The Republican party has embraced an opposite idea of American greatness, one mirroring Andrew Jackson’s and James Polk’s aspirations to double or triple the country’s land mass. According to this vision, a nation’s strength correlates to the amount of real estate it takes up on a map, not the quality of its infrastructure or the health and prosperity? of its people.

It’s perhaps fitting that the first real estate developer to become president should view the world in such stark territorial terms. But the question for voters will increasingly become the same issue that Americans in the 19th century faced. Does your family’s future and well-being rest on investments in America as it is, or do the acquisition of Canada, Greenland and Panama create the best path forward?

Whether we grow over time or space is once again a burning question.
