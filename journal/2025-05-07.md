## Story From Our Community (Rohr's)

>“A Prayer for the Exiles” 

Holy One, have mercy on your exiles,\  
those of us who no longer fit\ 
within the traditional teachings of the church.\ 
Those whose voice falters in the songs,\ who cannot say “Amen,”\ 
who desperately think of something else during the sermon….\ 
Have mercy on us, Holy God,\ 
those exiles who cling to faith\ 
and yearn for a bigger, wider story,\ 
a bigger, wider community.\ 
A story that embraces the vast expanses of time and space,\
and the enormous complexity of the cosmos.\ 
A community in which everything and everyone is connected\ 
and embraced.\ 
Holy God, …\ 
be born again in us, your exiles,\ 
Tell your story in words that we can understand. 

—Janet D.
