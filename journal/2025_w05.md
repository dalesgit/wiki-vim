[The Guardian view on commemorating Auschwitz’s liberation: the urgency of Holocaust remembrance | Editorial | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-commemorating-auschwitzs-liberation-the-urgency-of-holocaust-remembrance)
- Memory is fragile. A decade ago, 300 survivors gathered at Auschwitz to commemorate the Nazi death camp’s liberation. On Monday, 50 [will assemble](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/13/speeches-by-politicians-banned-at-80th-anniversary-of-auschwitzs-liberation) for the 80th anniversary. The median age of Holocaust survivors was estimated at 86 in a study [published last year](https://www.timesofisrael.com/global-study-finds-number-of-holocaust-survivors-shrank-by-half-since-2000/). At 97, Esther Senot is [still keeping the promise](https://www.thelocal.at/20250115/how-did-the-world-allow-auschwitz-nazi-death-camp-survivors-speak-out-ahead-of-anniversary) she made to her dying sister Fanny, whose last wish was that she “tell what happened to us ... so that we are not forgotten by history.” Almost 1 million of the 6 million Jews murdered in the [Holocaust](https://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust) were killed at the complex in German-occupied Poland, along with smaller numbers of Poles, Roma and Sinti, Soviet prisoners of war, gay men, political prisoners and others. Its name has become synonymous with evil.

SD notes

- I've created a repo just for SD (logseq-sd). I've tried to clean up the other repos that had SD material. 
- Along the way I have discovered that these local repositories have retained their history so the overall size of the folder (ncdu) hasn't reduced.
- Got the tripod on the Zoom camera to be more solid and realized there's a variety of ways to configure the 3-d movement.
- MP has agreed to my getting a monocular for the trip -- reluctantly, I think, but she said, "Yes."

Writing

I'm aware that I haven't written a daily journal kind of stuff in quite a while. This was after Shea asked me if I'd kept copies of the journals I've done for years now.
