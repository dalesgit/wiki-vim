# Introduction

## Dream

:dream: [/dream.md](/dream.md) Gail from Monroe was trying to persuade me to use the something called the "Three Kisses". Some kind of religious gimmick related to death and grieving. There had been a death. I was invited expected to be a part of it. It was big. A friend (Fr. Tim?) was accompanying me. It was moved to a big facility because of the crowds. A bishop figure? 

## Technical
