**Deliver bread and wine to Jim and Myrna**

Owen hasn't responded to my request to talk. I wonder why? Is it that there is bad blood between us? That he feels bad blood? He expects anger from me? 
1. I am glad for his efforts to help my daughter. 
2. How could I help?
3. What I feel is sadness.

Meeting with Zach: report to [[/SD-Verbatim]] ?
