Called Kalani about feeling the pounding yesterday in my heart.

Pick up Amy / Patch. Use non-highway route.

- By all means don't return to Sotalol. If I were to do that I would need to have a pacemaker installed. In the meantime, monitor the episodes. Try to capture with EKG device. If need be schedule an early follow-up.

Gym followed by Domoishi with kids.
