# Gratitude Journal 

- MP got into bed by herself at 7am this morning, as I watched looking over her.
- I was writing a note to Patrick Judge in my sleep. :dream:
- There is a tremendous burden with re. the Treeology guy, recommended by Mike. He is uneducated, teeth missing, speaks with an accent that makes it difficult to understand, he is MAGA, and he jokes in inappropriate ways that feels aggressive. I wish I could just have him disappear, but he knows trees and he would give us the most value. This piece that I react against is a blessing that I can't yet discern.

- Reviewing the paperwork from Treeology with MP. She is very negative about the paperwork. It's obviously not itemized. She reminded that one of the concerns we had when doing the windows was the difference between a 1 page summary proposal vs. a detailed itemized one. 
- There are problems with the proposal, most notably that he apparently doesn't include the laurel oak in the front. It is also very scary to think that we are responsible for everything that might be damaged. 
- She suggests getting more evaluations from recommendations from Marty or Al Kunkel.
- MP was expecting maybe a couple thousand dollars, and is anxious about our large upcoming bills due.
