## meeting with [/Linda.md](Linda.md) @ 3pm

Outstanding resource for annotating PDF in Obsidian, including an OCR tool to make them highlightable. It worked on a difficult piece that Linda sent: https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotating-locally-saved-pdfs/. OCR tool at: https://docdrop.org/ocr/

I think I might get better compatibility between Obsidian and Wiki.vim by using wiki links in Obsidian. Markdown links look better in vim, but Obsidian handles the spaces in titles better with wiki links.

The annotation tool in Obsidian looks to be pretty powerful.
