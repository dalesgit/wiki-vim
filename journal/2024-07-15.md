# Gratitude Journal 
- :dream: [dream](/dream.md) that again felt basically positive. I was involved with caring for others and it was basically working. There were challenges but they were basically being solved.
- Evening with the Hoopers. Larry talked freely but listened freely. I told stories: Stanley Hauerwas, "Have a nice day." Phantom Valley Ranch. He told stories of his marriage to Kathy, riding a horse in West Virginia before their wedding. It was a wild one, planted by a family member purposely to get the outsider. His mixture of feeling about doing funerals back at the former cure. I told re. John Horbuckle.
- MP is losing ½ pound a day the last week.
# Diary 
- MP sometimes freaks out when I am upset over something. e.g. if I complain about "the liturgy of Kevin" or try to say that I have had too much of St. Alfred's in a given week, that is turned into "You hate St. Alfred's." I have frequently used as a reference point Scott's observation of some time ago that MP is clearly very **codependent**. She wants to be in charge of everyone's happiness.
