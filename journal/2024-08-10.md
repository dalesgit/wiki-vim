# Gratitude Journal 

- The commitment to better communicate abut money with MP
- The little bit of thought and self-expression that has come with my shift in recording my reading.
- The potato soup that I made https://sugarspunrun.com/creamy-potato-soup-recipe/ I made all kinds of substitutions or left stuff out -- cf. all the rich stuff like "cream", but I really liked what came through.

# Diary 

- Made an alias to get to the "security" folder in Google Drive
- Susan Grayshaw's funeral today. remember the smile. she wanted to know name of the least. 
- what am I going to do with Tricia on Thursday's mass
-[/Movie.md](/Movie.md) tonight was *God's Crooked lines*. Filmed in Spain. Luxurious location. A former monastery? An estate? Portraying an asylum. I liked it. MP disliked it. It continuously portrayed sanity / insanity such that we were left questioning which was which.
