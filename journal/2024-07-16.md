- Scheduled AirHawk mainetenance visit next Wed. It turns out that they don't come out for a year on a new install. (Our maintenance contract had been canceled at the time of installation. specs for new filter:

- [HVAC](/HVAC.md):HVAC: Airhawk reported to us that we need 20x20x4 filter. That ends up being a "nominal" size. Also there are several additional factors:
- Merv rating: 8 is a general purpose residential rating. Higher numbers filter more but put a drag on the fan and motor of the furnace. At this point I don't know which we have nor which is recommended by the manufacturer. cf. [MERV 8 vs MERV 11 Air Filters: Which Should I Use?](https://filterbuy.com/resources/across-the-nation/merv-8-vs-merv-11/#:~:text=A%20MERV%208%20filter%20is,with%20allergies%20or%20respiratory%20issues. "MERV 8 vs MERV 11 Air Filters: Which Should I Use?")
- Then some manufacturers offer a carbon additional factor. (Nordic) 
- scheduled to get here July 19.

Very cool "hack" from one of Google's leads. To get evenly spaced slices of cheese: imprint the tines of a fork in the edge, then use the imprints as a guide for each slice. Uniform and regular. About the right size. :kitchen:
