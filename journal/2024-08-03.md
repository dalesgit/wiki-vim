# Gratitude Journal 

- I think I have a way to see the missal at the altar better: lower power glasses, ironman version that makes them less delicate.
- Looking at myself as MP gets stronger and I get shunted back to my usual supporting role. Am I OK with that? I'm grateful for getting Â½ way to answering the question.

# Diary 

- In email from St. Andrew's: [Hawaiian values](/Hawaiian values.md)
- Talked with [/Mary Pat.md](/Mary Pat.md) about the timeline of our being in the house together because of [Covid](/Covid.md). I have thought about it over the last few months because of the stereotype of the husband wife being stuck together at retirement, then the husband being kicked out of the house by the wife, "to find a job."
