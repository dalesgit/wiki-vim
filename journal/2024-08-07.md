# Gratitude Journal 

- I've exercised 2 days in a row. 
- I got almost 8 hours of sleep.
- The little conversation with the woman who was marking the utilities around the potential tree to be removed. It's not a healthy tree, but it's not a threat to a building the way the one in back is. 

# Diary 

- Is it possible to get "pdf's" indexed with the rest of the "md" files?
from documentation:

*g:wiki_filetypes*
  List of filetypes for which `wiki.vim` should be enabled. As explained in
  |wiki-filetype-spec|, the filetypes are specified by the file extension.

  The first element of the list is considered the default filetype where that
  is relevant.

  Default: `['md']`
- I think there's not a way: filetypes are: md, wiki, org, and something else text wise
