SD notes

- I've created a repo just for SD (logseq-sd). I've tried to clean up the other repos that had SD material. 
- Along the way I have discovered that these local repositories have retained their history so the overall size of the folder (ncdu) hasn't reduced.
- Got the tripod on the Zoom camera to be more solid and realized there's a variety of ways to configure the 3-d movement.
- MP has agreed to my getting a monocular for the trip -- reluctantly, I think, but she said, "Yes."

Writing

I'm aware that I haven't written a daily journal kind of stuff in quite a while. This was after Shea asked me if I'd kept copies of the journals I've done for years now.
