## Linda email:
Dear Linda,

Returning from our travels, I am slowly trying to get my feet back on the ground. Both of us are feeling **alienated** in a variety of ways, each of us in different ways. In a big and amorphous way, we are feeling disconnected from this country we have returned to as if for the first time. Things have changed in this country so dramatically since January. Mary Pat has had a struggle throughout the cruise and continuing now with the pain from her fall in February. I am strugglng with experiencing the church as a silent collaborator with the regime. I know some in our local church are looking to me as some kind of support or authority. The rector seems more and more detached. 

And I have been absent for **so long** from the Spiritual Directors Group. 

I want to schedule a time for my own SD with you. Our last appointment was February 21. My Friday's are generally open. All of the days are mostly filled with doctor's appointments of various kinds. If you could make a suggestion I can probably make that work.

Secondly, I seriously question whether I should try to return to the group at this point where the final presentations are bring the modules to a close. I think I would be a distraction -- but perhaps not a major or significant distraction. I am looking to you either ask me the appropriate question or give me your sense of things from the perspective of the director.
