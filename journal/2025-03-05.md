# Observe
We both felt like we were "coming home" as we landed at the airport. The lights along H-1. 

No one met us at Hale Malia, but we moved into the room we've stayed at on the first floor. I went to sleep quickly. MP **stayed** up to greet Gary when he got back from rehearsal. The play is "My name is Asher Lev" from the novel by Chaim Potok. Gary gave me a used copy of the book to take on our journey.
