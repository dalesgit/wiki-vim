# Gratitude Journal 

- [MP](/MP.md) has made giant leaps. Walking around the house better than before the surgery.
- I felt pretty strong in celebrating last night. Mark told me afterward that he was so moved by the Spirit I gave off when I lead worship. He said it with tears, and both of us mumbled the notion that it's not us but **Grace**. The big flaw was I forgot the fraction -- Peter's weird pattern of the focus on celebrant doesn't happen at the fraction but at the end of communion.
