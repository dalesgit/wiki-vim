# Diary 

- A blowup with [/MP.md](/MP.md) this morning around finances. She said to me, "What did you buy with 4 transactions last night?" I had bought things for the kitchen. Then I bought the burr grinder -- something of an extravagance -- but what I thought was the best value for an appliance I use every day and she doesn't at all. Then this morning I bought her birthday present, following the same kind of evaluation. Her response was to say that I am now in charge of finances, spreadsheet and all.
- I responded by being more upset than I have in a long time. Called her the "queen". I know my reaction was the buildup of lots of things: her surgery/recovery, our lifelong pattern that she has been the one who has final say on any purchase, â€¦
