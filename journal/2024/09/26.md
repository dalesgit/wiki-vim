## Working with wiki-vim
- trying out this method of tracking the journal by folders. I really kind of like it, because it groups similar files rather than just being a long list of files. Also the summary file might be useful.
- [[/Journal-index.md|Journal-index]]
- changed the keybinding for moving between journals "[w" "]w"
