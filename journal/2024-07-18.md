# Gratitude Journal 

- The day has arrived for the surgery. I slept **very** poorly and I didn't know why. Worry? Unknowns? Too hot in the room (I see as I get up that the temperature is turned up. But perhaps MP did it already?
- But I'm grateful for the breakthroughs in surgery and the expertise of surgeons (a woman!).
