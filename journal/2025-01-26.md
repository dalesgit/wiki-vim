[This US President Said Canada Would Fall Like ‘Easy Prey.’ It Wasn’t Donald Trump. - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/26/trump-canada-whig-party-00200504)
- Trump, after all, is not the first president to entertain fever dreams of conquering our neighbor to the north. Credible presidents and statesmen articulated the same aspirations throughout the early 19th century. At issue was not Canada, per se, but whether the U.S. should grow over space, expanding its geographic territory, or over time, investing in its infrastructure and industries to accelerate progress. It became a defining divide between the Whig and Democratic parties in the antebellum era, and in some fashion, appears to have reemerged as a lens through which we can understand the Democratic and Republican parties today.
