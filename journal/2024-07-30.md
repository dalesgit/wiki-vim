# Gratitude Journal 

- I wrote with a bit more fluidity. 
- [MP](/MP.md)'s new therapist, Laura, was efficient and helpful in pushing her to the next level.
- I really liked the annotations I started in my **Obsidian-library** files. It forces me to think at each of the articles. It sets it up for a next level synthesis.  

# Diary 

- Why hasn't O'neil's tree service responded? That's a real negative, along with the administrator I can't understand.
- Blessed are the **peacemakers** for they will be called **children of God**. 
    - What does it mean to be a peacemaker?
        - Not the absence of peace. 
    - What are children of God?
        - always reject the parents before joining them?
- from [Scott](/Scott.md):
    - Loa's surgery will be this Friday.
