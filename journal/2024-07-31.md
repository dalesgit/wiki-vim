# Gratitude Journal 

- MP has now been able to get herself into bed, lifting her leg with the strap. She knows I've been struggling and wants to do more things to "make you happy." I'm feeling worn out and just want to be alone for a while. **Not properly grateful**.
- I dreamed successively through the sessions of waking to pee -- first I would become aware that she was awake, then I would do the little she needed to get back into bed. :dream: The dream was doing the note-taking while reading Guenther's book. I'm excited, I guess, to possibly returning to some echo of my school days, Notre Dame et al.
- I really like the taste of *sour cream Ruffles*. I really like the taste of *Fudge stripes*.
