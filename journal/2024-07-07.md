# Introduction
:dream: I was at a lodge. Working and there were lots of kids around. Sort of like Ft. Collins had been. I was married to some blend of each of my wives. She tolerated me. I was skiing (nordic) at the end of a work day. I got delayed watching some kind of demolition to an old lamp stand. I was thus late to get back to the house. I forgot my skis. Went back to fetch them but they had already been put on a sledge by the workman doing the dismantling. He took off with the skis. I didn't know how I was going to get them back.
