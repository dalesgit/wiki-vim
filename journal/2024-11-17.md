## Bill phone 17 Nov 2024 Sun 08:43 PM

He reports that "the group" (the world group) has been concerned about her [[/MP.md]] because she has been incommuniado all week.

Bill's approach to post-election was to:

1. Not let Trump get their "goat" which is clearly his goal
2. It may not be as bad as people's expectations. Rachel Maddow: look at what happened his first term. Perhaps people will not follow with his radical moves.

## another TV show that I didn't think MP & I would watch

Pedro PÃ¡ramo, influence on Magic Realism.
