> The Celtic approach to God opens up a world in which nothing is too common to be exalted and nothing is so exalted that it cannot be made common. —Esther de Waal

This seems to be the impulse behind Butler-Bass's *Grounded*. The quote here is from

@U5UTBL84#Rupp_2012 . 

> I used to keep my spiritual life in a tight space and felt that my work, my social life, my relational joys and struggles actually kept me away from God rather than teaching me and being sources of personal transformation for me. (p.24) … I try now to approach each person, event, creature, with two questions: **How are you my teacher? What am I meant to learn**?

This is exactly what Linda asks me. I long to be more adept at this art (practice?) of recognizing the sacred in the ordinary.
