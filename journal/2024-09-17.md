Diary 
- tree coming down. What an operation. Both neighbors seem to be OK. See photos. It's now possible to imagine a lanai in the back. Once I let go of my romance with the giant tree in back, I have just wanted it to be gone.
- 10 minutes with Whistler's "Nocturne in Blue and Silver". Interesting task. Echoes of Nouwen with his Rembrandt. It is whispery, suggestive, ethereal. There is a city with smokestacks. And a large, dominating river. There are a few shrubs in the bottom, suggestive of Japanese calligraphy. And a mysterious object, perhaps standing on a small beach.
