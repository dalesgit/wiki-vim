- :todo: thank you to Lou and Elaine
- installed "krop" to separate out the double pages of pdf files
- cf. also "pdf shuffler" [is this "pdfarranger" and "pdfchain"?
- Make notes in "Okular" then use Obsidian highlighter to copy the highlights
- The method above is quite workable I think. 
- I think this is my primary "personal knowledge app". I need to be conscious of how much needs to go in this and how it needs to be annotated.
