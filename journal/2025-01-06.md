# Technicl

## Seem to have fixed the excess markdownlint-cli2 notices

- with a .yaml file at the the root folder
- [.markdownlint-cli2.yaml](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2/blob/main/test/markdownlint-cli2-yaml-example/.markdownlint-cli2.yaml)
- with a lua file pointing to the global .yaml file

## [/lesser-feasts-list](/lesser-feasts-list) This is a test of inserting links

- I have settled on requiring wiki-vim for this.

## Might it be possible to get the color on the heading highlight a little bit softer? or varied?

- done with changing the colors in "headings.lua"
