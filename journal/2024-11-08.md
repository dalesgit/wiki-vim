- ## Diary
- **Shirley**'s birthday
- ## What are the things that I have lost? [[2024-11-08-Friday]] #grief
- We are no longer a nation where a sense of fairness and justice is appropriate.
- We are a nation where the quest for **power** is the number one value
- Democracy has failed. Demagoguery has won.
- I will die as a resident of a dictatorship
- The nation has abandoned a trust in truth and honesty
- Our "Better angels" is a travesty, a farce, a betrayal, a cowardly accession to Constantinian compromise (for the sake of power)
- How have I dealt with grief in the past? Children moving to Colorado? Father? Mother? Emma?
- The feelings re. Trump are similar to what I felt with [[1731069066-bridget|Bridget]]. Victory for her was winning at all costs. The human was removed. Vengeance even at her own expense.
