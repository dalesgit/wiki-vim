Lessons and Carols felt so much like a "performance." I am going to stop participating in Kevin's "performance" at the end of the service.

I was latched onto this evening by Margaret (of Highland Lakes). She is life-long Catholic but has accompanied Dora Lee this past few months (years?). She wants to pass on info about services to help those with no cars. She has mostly stopped driving. She is 92, 93 soon.

Al Kunkel was talking with Ralph (debating a Maga afficianado.) Earlier apparently had done the same with Marcus. I find myself with no patience for such a thing.
