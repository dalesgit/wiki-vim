## Letter to River

As your recent birthday approached, I reflected on how much I don't know about your life, your hopes, your disappointments, your challenges. I reflected on my daughters Lydia and Emma and where they were at age 13. 2005 and 2007, respectively. I didn't really know it at the time, but later I realized that I was pretty clueless about what was going on with their inner and outer lives. I loved them fiercely. I used to often tell the story about how parenting has a lot to do with letting go of their hands. "We want them to be safe when they cross a busy road. We hold their hands and cross the traffic together for a period of time. But the point of parenting is that we have to let go of their hands." All of which is to say that I really do have a special place in my heart for you, and I hope really hard that you are doing just great at "crossing the traffic." 

Much love, Grandpa Dale
