**Living with an Open Heart: A Sufi Approach to Suffering with Omid Safi**

How do we respond to a world full of suffering and injustice while staying connected to love? Join Sufi scholar Omid Safi to explore the deep spiritual call to share in our common humanity and confront the pain and polarization around us. Omid challenges us to examine our biases—who do we believe is sacred?—and to recognize the interconnectedness of all life. We’ll discuss the role of sacred rage, the balance between contemplation and action, and how prayer alone is not enough. Omid also offers profound insights on personal suffering, showing us how witnessing, silence, and gentleness can transform our pain into deeper love. Whether you’re on the frontlines of justice or navigating your own trials, this conversation will inspire you to engage the world with both heart and courage.

- Lives in American South. White man, younger than he, calls him "boy". Accompanied with assumptions.
- Islam: "Paradise is a **walled garden**"
- "Rage" can be warranted. Some things: "If you're not angry about it you're not really alive."
- Not just "thoughts and prayers" with no action is nothing.
- Prophet teaches: "How do you help the oppressor?" Answ: "You stop him."
