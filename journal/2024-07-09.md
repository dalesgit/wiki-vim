# notes on links, trying to get interchangeability
The mappings that act on links are listed in |wiki-mappings-default|. The most
notable default mappings are:
- A link may be followed with `<cr>`.
- `<cr>` used on normal text (not on a link) will transform the text into
  a link of the type specified by |g:wiki_link_creation|. This also works in
  visual mode.
- Similarly, `gl` may be used to turn operated text into a link.
- One may use `<bs>` to navigate back after following a link.
- `<leader>wf` can be used to transform a link between different types (see
  |g:wiki_link_transforms|).
