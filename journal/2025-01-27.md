[The Guardian view on commemorating Auschwitz’s liberation: the urgency of Holocaust remembrance | Editorial | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-commemorating-auschwitzs-liberation-the-urgency-of-holocaust-remembrance)
- Memory is fragile. A decade ago, 300 survivors gathered at Auschwitz to commemorate the Nazi death camp’s liberation. On Monday, 50 [will assemble](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/13/speeches-by-politicians-banned-at-80th-anniversary-of-auschwitzs-liberation) for the 80th anniversary. The median age of Holocaust survivors was estimated at 86 in a study [published last year](https://www.timesofisrael.com/global-study-finds-number-of-holocaust-survivors-shrank-by-half-since-2000/). At 97, Esther Senot is [still keeping the promise](https://www.thelocal.at/20250115/how-did-the-world-allow-auschwitz-nazi-death-camp-survivors-speak-out-ahead-of-anniversary) she made to her dying sister Fanny, whose last wish was that she “tell what happened to us ... so that we are not forgotten by history.” Almost 1 million of the 6 million Jews murdered in the [Holocaust](https://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust) were killed at the complex in German-occupied Poland, along with smaller numbers of Poles, Roma and Sinti, Soviet prisoners of war, gay men, political prisoners and others.

- One song that’s become a soulmate to my personal AI algorithm is Three Dog Night’s 1972 No. 1 remake of “[Black and White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f65mO146Zo)” — a 3-minute-and-24-second window into what it felt like to be a 13-year-old in a moment that was supposed to last forever until it didn’t. [The song](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/three-dog-night/black-and-white) was actually written in the 1950s (lyrics by actor Alan Arkin’s father, David, sung first by Pete Seeger) to celebrate a nation that was finally overcoming its grim history of racial segregation in the classroom.

- Instead, it was all a dream — one which came under attack from American viruses we foolishly thought lay dormant — until it finally died (beyond any irony thought possible, on the federal holiday for MLK) in the Capitol Rotunda at precisely noon [on Jan. 20, 2025](https://www.inquirer.com/columnists/attytood/trump-day-one-inauguration-20250121.html).
