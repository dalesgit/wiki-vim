[The Guardian view on commemorating Auschwitz’s liberation: the urgency of Holocaust remembrance | Editorial | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-commemorating-auschwitzs-liberation-the-urgency-of-holocaust-remembrance)
- Memory is fragile. A decade ago, 300 survivors gathered at Auschwitz to commemorate the Nazi death camp’s liberation. On Monday, 50 [will assemble](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/13/speeches-by-politicians-banned-at-80th-anniversary-of-auschwitzs-liberation) for the 80th anniversary. The median age of Holocaust survivors was estimated at 86 in a study [published last year](https://www.timesofisrael.com/global-study-finds-number-of-holocaust-survivors-shrank-by-half-since-2000/). At 97, Esther Senot is [still keeping the promise](https://www.thelocal.at/20250115/how-did-the-world-allow-auschwitz-nazi-death-camp-survivors-speak-out-ahead-of-anniversary) she made to her dying sister Fanny, whose last wish was that she “tell what happened to us ... so that we are not forgotten by history.” Almost 1 million of the 6 million Jews murdered in the [Holocaust](https://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust) were killed at the complex in German-occupied Poland, along with smaller numbers of Poles, Roma and Sinti, Soviet prisoners of war, gay men, political prisoners and others. Its name has become synonymous with evil.

- One song that’s become a soulmate to my personal AI algorithm is Three Dog Night’s 1972 No. 1 remake of “[Black and White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f65mO146Zo)” — a 3-minute-and-24-second window into what it felt like to be a 13-year-old in a moment that was supposed to last forever until it didn’t. [The song](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/three-dog-night/black-and-white) was actually written in the 1950s (lyrics by actor Alan Arkin’s father, David, sung first by Pete Seeger) to celebrate a nation that was finally overcoming its grim history of racial segregation in the classroom. 

…

- Instead, it was all a dream — one which came under attack from American viruses we foolishly thought lay dormant — until it finally died (beyond any irony thought possible, on the federal holiday for MLK) in the Capitol Rotunda at precisely noon [on Jan. 20, 2025](https://www.inquirer.com/columnists/attytood/trump-day-one-inauguration-20250121.html). The utopian harmonies of “Black and White” are no longer the law of all the land.

      - The colorful menagerie of people who make up the proposed Trump cabinet all have one thing in common: They are self-identified disrupters. They aim to burn the systems down. Disruption is fine in the private sector. If Musk wants to start a car company and it flops, then all that’s been lost is investor money and some jobs. But suppose you disrupt and dismantle the Defense Department or the judicial system or the schools? Where are citizens supposed to go?
      - The history of the world since at least the French Revolution is that rapid disruption makes governments cataclysmically worse. Trump, the anti-institutionalist, is creating an electoral monarchy, a system in which all power is personalized and held in his hands. That’s a recipe for distorted information flows, corruption, instability and administrative impotence. As we’ve seen over and over again down the centuries, there’s a big difference between people who operate in the spirit of disruption and those who operate in the spirit of reform.
