# Gratitude Journal 
- I didn't wake to pee until 6:30 last night.
- For this journal system with **Vim**.
- The bonded connections and community that MP knows in St. Alfred's -- in evidence last night at the movie night at church
- "Welcome, welcome, my irritation at spending so much of my time supporting MP. "God is working on me." What is my irritation telling me? My need for autonomy. For self-focused time. My need for self-care. Let go. Pay attention.
- Volunteer at hospital with babies? Homeless? Remember the infants in the pool and one of them had her **Grandpa** to learn to swim with.
