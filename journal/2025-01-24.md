## Card to Karla

Dear Karla, You've been a sister to me for so long, but I think I have seldom, if ever, sent you a note just for you. I took a little bit of delight for myself when I heard you were going away for a few days for your birthday. I do hope this finds you soaking in a little bit of awe and sunshine -- well, just because of you. That would be a personalized gift and one that you could "bank on" in the sphere of memories and gladness. If we were there we'd find some way to sing you happy birthday. You've been spared that -- but know that Mary Pat and I wish you a wonderful birthday and all the best for the year upcoming.

Love Dale and Mary Pat
