	- Life can change so quickly. 9/29 my parents came to stay with us after an ER visit on Maui, which provided mom a â€œpresumedâ€ pancreatic cancer diagnosis. 10/11 Fred Hutch confirmed the news. 10/30 mom passed peacefully with her husband of 59 years, Kevin, Phil and I holding her hands.

	  The amount of love and support from our family and friends has been astonishing.  A massive thank you to my big brother Phil, Aunt Jill and Aunt Michele for pulling many all-nighters to ensure mom had her meds every 4 hours and would have family by her side at all times. Thank you Jodean and Brian for the fridge full of dinners and breakfast. It truly took a village over the past month, and we have a great village .

- We are no longer a nation where a sense of fairness and justice is appropriate.
- We are a nation where the quest for **power** is the number one value
- Democracy has failed. Demagoguery has won.
- I will die as a resident of a dictatorship
- The nation has abandoned a trust in truth and honesty

  Insight about grieving: It combines my intensely personal feelings with a communal event:
