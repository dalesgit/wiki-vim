- 1st night MP home. It went tolerably well. She will need to get down the trip to and from the toilet. And then it will be on to bigger and better things.

# Diary 

- Made the drug chart for MP [Mary Pat](/Mary Pat.md)

- Brian says ice: 30 on / 30 off
- take the docusate 2 pd at night: it keeps stool soft.
