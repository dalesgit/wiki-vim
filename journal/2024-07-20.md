# Gratitude Journal 

- 1st night MP home. It went tolerably well. She will need to get down the trip to and from the toilet. And then it will be on to bigger and better things.

# Diary 

- Made the drug chart for MP [Mary Pat](/Mary Pat.md)
- will need to refine it
- Brian says ice: 30 on / 30 off
- take the docusate 2 pd at night: it keeps stool soft.

- Loa has her cath procedure on Thursday July 25. She has 70/50 blockages. They may do stents. But because her diabetes since 4 y/o complicates her situation, they may decide that they will have to do surgery.

brought dinner & she talked for an hour while I assembled the shower chair. MP got angry when I loaded all the boxes that I was out of reach and she needed to go to the toilet.
