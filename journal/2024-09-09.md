Diary 

- Gym. [/MP.md](/MP.md) is ok for now, but I may end up going with her to the pool
- Finished reading Guenther. @TN73JIT9#Guenther_1992n Our life journeys traveled a lot of similar territory. 
- On the Beelink with Budgie -- which I like working with -- it would lock up on autosuspend. There is a google history to that. I have turned it off.
