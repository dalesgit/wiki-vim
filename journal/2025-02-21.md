This Award Winning Map is the Most Accurate Picture of Earth Ever Created:  
  
We've been viewing the world incorrectly for 500 years.  
  
The traditional world map, first designed by Gerardus Mercator in 1569, has long been criticized for its significant distortions.  
  
It exaggerates the size of regions in the northern hemisphere, such as Europe and North America, while diminishing those closer to the equator.  
  
Greenland, for example, appears the size of Africa on many maps, despite being 14 times smaller.  
  
In the 1970s, German journalist Arno Peters publicly denounced the Mercator projection, highlighting its role in perpetuating a Eurocentric worldview. Even modern alternatives often fail to accurately represent landmasses like Antarctica.  
  
Now, Tokyo-based architect and artist Hajime Narukawa won Japan's prestigious Good Design Award for developing the AuthaGraph World Map, a groundbreaking projection that preserves the true proportions of continents and oceans.  
  
By dividing the globe into 96 triangles, then transferring these to a tetrahedron and unfolding it into a rectangle, the AuthaGraph map eliminates the distortions found in both the Mercator and Dymaxion maps.  
  
Remarkably, it also allows for seamless tiling, enabling users to reposition regions at the center while maintaining accurate geographical relationships.  
  
The creators of the AuthaGraph map argue that, while traditional maps prioritized land, today’s global challenges demand a broader focus on oceans and polar regions. Issues such as melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and the territorial claims over marine resources require an accurate and unbiased representation of the Earth.  
  
By offering a fresh perspective, the AuthaGraph map aims to help users better understand the interconnectedness of our planet's land and water systems. Imagine, too, how this innovative map could reshape our view of 600 million years of continental drift

Well take an orange and peel it as carefully as you can and then mash it flat and see how that works out for you. I think they do a very good job.

Didn't Buckminster Fuller design such a map? And when on sturdy paper or cardboard, the triangles allowed it to be folded into a round-ish shape, thus earth-like? Think geodesic domes ....

this is dumb for many reason, but mostly because Globes have been around for a very long time

And Europe isn’t a continent. Never was.
