# Gratitude Journal 

I remember going to sleep last night, having told MP that lately I had been dreaming about [/Lydia.md](/Lydia.md). She responded by asking if I had called her lately. I was irritated by that response. She knew that I had not called. She is always wanting a phone call over other communication. It doesn't work so well for me. But I said that she had not responded to any of my overtures. I, however, wondered what this night's sleep would bring.

As it turns out, Tue 2024-08-13 07:49:24-0400, I didn't dream about Lydia.  [/dream.md](/dream.md) There were 2 things to note. 

1. My common dreams :dream: for many years have involved not being able to complete something, not being able to get to my planned destination. Often involving a train and missing the connection. More often, now, I am able to make the train. Not that I have **arrived**, but I'm on my way.
2. The theme I was wrestling with in my final hour had to do with my being a spiritual director. I thought that my biggest concern had to do with the practicalities of **starting**, hanging my shingle. I thought I have been made to be a spiritual director. I've been doing [spiritual direction](/spiritual direction.md) for most of the last 45 years. How arrogant, but real.

As I write this in the morning, I think that the better time for doing "gratitude" writing is in the evening ("examen"). The better time for writing is in the morning. I need to figure out how to organize that.
