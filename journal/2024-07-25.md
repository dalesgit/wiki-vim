@8BVJ45VI#Smith_2019 How do people use Zotero? I need to borrow this from church library (cf. Al Kunkel)

This is a note from the database:

## Mass today :reflection:

- James the greater (John -- sons of thunder). Gospel was mother (wife of "thunder") asking that her sons be seated to the right and left in heaven. Peter spoke of our asking God to do things our way. I thought of Notre Dame and the extraordinary people I met and heard. What do I do with that â€¦ to be servant given those opportunities?
