[[MP]] struggles with DOK. They are too focused inward, she says. I said that the issue for her was that she is so passionate about things: angry? wanting to fix them?

:tech: I am still struggling to get a workflow for using this powerful system -- whether it's logseq/obsidian or vim/nvim. [/home/dale/Repositories/wiki-vim/technical.md](/technical.md) 

- where use tags?
- link ala Logseq? that makes backlinks especially useful.
- Working through the "index" seems promising.
