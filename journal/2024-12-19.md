Mostly finished reinstalling Linux on Lenovo after crashing it with an experiment to see if I could get a "desktop installed". A lot of refinements in e.g. vimrc are not yet *accomplished*. 

cf. note in[[/technical.md]] wiki-vim in nvim. Other issues in nvim still not straightened out, e.g. keystrokes I had utilized. Also e.g. the display of links in vim. (conceal?) I set conceallevel=2, it's working as per e.g. "accomplished" above. But it doesn't affect the links.
