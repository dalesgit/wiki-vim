# Gratitude Journal 

I went to sleep wondering what the night would bring. The [/dream](/dream.md)s seemed to flow from the challenge I felt in patiently enduring the gum treatment yesterday at the periodontist, alongside the thriller/mystery we watched on TV. This isn't a dance in the park. 

I feel anxiety in the obligations I agreed to at church. This week celebrating -- with the wrinkle that much of it is tailored around Tricia's needs and Sandy Toller's conception of what liturgy is. I take some encouragement from Larry H. who took charge of what happened at the altar on Sunday.

# Diary 
## Florida story
I somehow have the "conquest of Florida from Tampa to the keys" on my mind. @WLPGJ9DL#Powell_1988 "MP and I read this book right after we moved to the mainland. I still think of Florida in the terms I met here. "
## Lectio today
In our prayer today: **John 20:17**. *I am ascending to my Father and to your father, your God and your God*.

- From the Keating reflection: I am skeptical about "Original Sin"
- I am cautious about the use of **free will** as a way of explaining the reality we know (cf. the many discussions with my students who lean into free will to understand evil.)
- I am rather inclined to think that there was a flaw in our manufacture. I imagine God saying, "I screwed that up, how can I fix it?" The way I have done countless times in my life.
- The text also reflects on the doctrine of the Trinity. And about that I am **cautious** -- cf. all the puerile explanations preached on that day in churches.

## Healing mass tomorrow
