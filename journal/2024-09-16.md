> My luck: I was scheduled to start my second job tonight to save up to get some work done on my car. Said car decides to completely stop working this morning. I slice three fingers picking up a baking dish, then I lock myself out of my house. Can I get a redo. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


- cf. message in the web version Kalani's healow service. It seems to indicate that I return the monitor to their office. But my directions were to mail it. Confirm. :todo:
- adjustment of meds: no aspirin one week prior to colonoscopy
- only 1 sotalol per diem: Kalani said evening, Laura (NA) was surprised by this.
- went to centering prayer at Lutheran Church.
