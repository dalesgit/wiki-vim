# Gratitude Journal 

- MP got up, to the toilet, and to her chair. To show she could do it. But also to offer a break to me.

# Diary 

- I feel so tired. I often get up as often as I had to, but somehow it feels less disruptive for me to just get up, groggily go to the toilet and pee, then back to bed. The pattern today is I am awakened from sleep, then spend several minutes lying on the floor in front of the bathroom, then help MP back into bed by lifting her legs.
- I got the name of arborist from Mike. **Now I need to schedule**.
