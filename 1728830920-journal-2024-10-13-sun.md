_Reflection for Spiritual Direction Course_

1. **I notice…(awareness)**: I am apathetic -- not caring -- as I watch and listen to the broadcast of St. Alfred's. LH celebrating, Peter preaching. MP expects to have veto power over everything. She pronounces that "medium" eggs was just fine. I looked at both medium and large and thought we should get large. She objected, saying, "What's wrong with medium?" I felt like she was right unless I could convince her otherwise. I wanted her to acknowledge my place to make a seemingly insignificant decision. I threw up my hands.

2. **I’m curious about… (attentive exploration)**: Why? It may have something to do with the piece that was shared with Hawai'i folks by Willard (?) Peter says, "It's good to be gathered together here!" But I say to myself, "No, I'm glad I'm not there."

What am I doing when I throw up my hands? Am I letting her rule? Am I voting that this isn't worth arguing over?

3. **I wonder how I can… (active response)**: Make a healthy decision? Know when I am acquiescing for the sake of peace and when I am failing to stand up for myself?
