- She asked if she was a wimp about the pain. I responded that everybody has different tolerances for pain. 

Brian the Home health nurse says that various things could cause leg edema. He used to get it from working long hours. Heart, vascular, etc. The pain she used to experience could have been caused by the edema itself pressing against nerves etc. [e.g. that's why diabetics get into trouble because they don't feel the pain and then that leads to problems.]

He told us about "boots" that can be purchased for home that facilitate circulation. "lymphodema"

- exercises intended to get circulation moving towards heart:
1. toes/ankle
2. straighten leg press down on knee
3. tighten gluts

- Breathing (3 in, 6 out)
- He talked about how need to eat because body is burning calories to heal the injury of the surgery. 
- For same reason there is heat in the affected leg/knee. May last several months. 
- He recommends that I keep the blue belt on until she is more secure
- accompany her at all times getting in/out of bed. He lifts her legs a little more aggressively than I have.
- Maybe get a power recliner
- also some kind of riser, like at the gym. Something that would slide.
