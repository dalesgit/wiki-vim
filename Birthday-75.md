# Birthday (75
## How did it happen?

Are you grown up yet?  
The Jewish orthodox position is that   
one ought not read the **Kabbalah** until   
At least your 40^th^ year.  
I know we're old enough to have a drink,  
Even though we've just this year   
been carded for a beer.   
What do you qualify for now that you're 75?

It's eye opening, like,   
"How did that happen?"   
I know that sounds goofy.   
"How did it happen?"

When I was 25   
I could kind of wrap my head around it.  
The years all seemed to connect,  
One to another, and add'em up you get 25.  
When I was 50 it seemed as if life had gotten away from me.   
By then my life was divided into epochs.   
My book was made up of chapters.  
I needed help to remember all the characters.  

But soon I'd move to Hawai'i.  
The years got away from me somehow.  
My life was made up of more   
Than a sequence of numbers.

Now you're turning 75   
and I'm hard on your tail   
in just another year.  
It all seems bewildering.   
Like, "How did that happen?"   
Like as a baby surprises a new mommy  
And somebody asks "How did that happen?"  
Here we are at an almost magical  
¾ of a century.

This is your life.   
No longer a sequence of memories,  
But a true story. Real like the *Velveteen Rabbit*.  
"The Velveteen Rabbit is a Horror Story[^1]  
thinks one author.  
If we knew then what we know now …  
This past year indicates there's pain enough  
Along the way.  
Can you hear it, sing it?  
Of course you can. 

"Can it be that it was all so simple then?  
Or has time rewritten every line?  
If we had the chance to do it all again  
Tell me, would we, could we?"

There's Hawai'i as well as a  
Surgical recovery room.  
There's vestry meetings  
And the lights of Amsterdam. 

But in these 70 plus years  
It's become **Our Story**  
And somehow  
That has made all the difference.  
You can say, "I love you."  
And mean it.
