# Birthday (75
## How did it happen?

Are you grown up yet
The Jewish orthodox position is that 
one ought not read the **Kabbalah** until one is at least 40
I know we old enough to have a drink
Even though we've just this year 
been carded for a beer 
What do you qualify for now that you're 75?

It's eye opening, like, 
"How did that happen?" 
I know that sounds goofy, 
like wondering about pregnancy, 
"How did that happen?"

When I was 25 
I could kind of wrap my head around it.
When I was 50 
it seemed as if life had gotten away from me. 
I was soon to move to Hawai'i 
and that combined with 50 years old 
totally caught me by surprise.

But now you're turning 75 
and I'm hard on your tail to get there in a year. 
It seems bewildering. 
Like, "How did that happen?" 
Like as a baby surprises a new mommy
And somebody asks "How did that happen?"
