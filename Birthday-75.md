# Birthday (75

- Judaism: one ought not read the **Kabbala** until one is at least 40
- One of our restaurants has carded us for a bear in the last year
- What do you qualify for now that you're 75?

It's eye opening, like, "How did that happen?" That sounds goofy, like wondering about pregnancy, "How did that happen?"
