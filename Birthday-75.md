# Birthday (75
## How did it happen?

- Judaism: one ought not read the **Kabbala** until one is at least 40
- One of our restaurants has carded us for a bear in the last year
- What do you qualify for now that you're 75?

It's eye opening, like, "How did that happen?" That sounds goofy, like wondering about pregnancy, "How did that happen?"

When I was 25 I could kind of wrap my head around it.

When I was 50 it seemed as if life had gotten away from me. I was soon to move to Hawai'i -- though that caught me by surprise.

But now you're turning 75 and I'm hard on your tail to get there in a year. It seems bewildering. Like, "How did that happen?"
