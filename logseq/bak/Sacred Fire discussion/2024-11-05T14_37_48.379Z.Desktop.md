## Notes
- help us to do it gallantly, p. 461. Peter  prays it ea. Day, focusing on a phrase.
- _In the Morning_  This is another day, O Lord. I know not what it will bring  
forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I  am to stand up, help me to stand bravely. If I am to sit still,  help me to sit quietly. If I am to lie low, help me to do it  patiently. And if I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly. Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit  of Jesus. _Amen._
- Karen Horney develops the difference individuation of girls vs. men
- *Raising Ophelia* book that Miriam sent me. 
- Tricia doesn't think there's that much different men and women
- Dora Lee was a Rockette. Spritely in spirit. 
- Tara calls makeup "war paint"
- Carol Gilligan (Jim also new her in NY) cf. @UVLINVSV#Bass_2015 chapter on Women in Ministry [[Women and spiritual direction|Women and spiritual direction]]

## notes
- instead of taking them into the deep woods as previous cultures have done and initiating them into adulthood, we hold our collective breath and pray that they will make it through these tumultuous years intact, physically and morally. For the most part, we no longer have any meaningful initiation rites to help turn an adolescent into an adult.
- on screen man (Ed): sexuality is next door to breathing. He's 90 and trying to figure out what life's about. He is getting more out of our discussion of Rohlheiser (over Rohr which he read alone). He's going on 92. "My brain is young."
- Tara: young people "know loss". I heard her say "**know lost**" is a more energetic expression. I like.
- Chapter 2 observes the list of **struggles** of the human enterprise. The answer to the struggles, he way to respond to them, is the **big 4** elements of **essential discipleship**.
- (94) "Mature Discipleship is the struggle to give our lives away, after we have attained initial maturity. This generally constitutes the longest period of our lives, our “householder” years—those thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty years between landing solidly somewhere in adulthood and looking at retirement and what lies beyond. Our basic anxiety during these years needs to be around the questions: How do I do this better, more generously? How do I make a deeper, more life-giving contribution?"
