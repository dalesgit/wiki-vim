- Another bicycle dream. I was being frustrated by a kind of evil bicycle shop. But the whole experience was of well-being and strength. I didn't want to leave it. I was able to bike from city to city and over mountains.
- For the energy that was generated in last night's liturgy. I was impressed that Peter started with David dancing in the streets. And then he did a sort of mimicing of a Jewish dance. 
  > Hava Nagila. The words are Hebrew for Let Us Rejoice. They also comprise the title of one of the most recognizable and well-known songs in the world. And little did I know just how appropriate a theme song it would turn out to be for a radio series called Ukrainian Jewish Heritage!
- I led us in singing Acapella the Doxology.
- I got laughter when I said that "Your rector is capable of dancing in the streets." And then kind of got us moving on the recession. MacKenzie, DeeDee's young granddaughter, serving at the altar, was the most free at moving, a little dance.
