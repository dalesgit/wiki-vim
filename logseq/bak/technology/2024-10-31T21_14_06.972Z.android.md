## Tue 03 Sep 2024
- Software: inserting date in .vimrc: :technology: [month](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html "strftime(3) - Linux manual page")
- Figuring out my own method of doing this note-taking:
1. Using the journal page to link to a subject page
2. From there time-stamping items
    - allowing for sub-subject links
3. Can I begin using this wiki as my personal information gathering place that makes sense?
