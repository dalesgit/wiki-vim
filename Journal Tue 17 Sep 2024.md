*Reflection for Spiritual Direction Course*

1. **I notice…(awareness)** I resonated powerfully to the images of the psalm at lectio last night. I have repeatedly that of the "kataphatic spirituality" I had in younger days -- e.g. **Charles Williams**. 
2. **I’m curious about… (attentive exploration)** What I should do about those things? What is the need I feel in these feelings coming to the fore?
3. **I wonder how I can… (active response)**: where is God? Curiously I'm not that concerned about that part of it.
