### Psalm 22:18-27

*Deus, Deus meus*

18 Be not far away, O **Lord**; *  
you are my strength; hasten to **help me**.

19 Save me from the **sword**, *  
my life from the power of the **dog**.

20 Save me from the **lion's mouth**, *  
my wretched body from the horns of wild **bulls**.

21 I will declare your Name to my **brethren**; *  
in the midst of the congregation I will **praise you**.

22 Praise the Lord, you that **fear him**; *  
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel;  
all you of Jacob's line, give **glory**.

23 For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty;  
neither does he hide his **face from them**; *  
but when they cry to him he **hears them**.

24 My praise is of him in the great as**sembly**; *  
I will perform my vows in the presence of those who **worship him**.

25 The poor shall eat and be satisfied,  
and those who seek the Lord shall **praise him**: *  
"May your heart live for **ever**!"

26 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the **Lord**, *  
and all the families of the nations shall bow be**fore him**.

27 For kingship belongs to the **Lord**; *  
he rules over the **nations**.
