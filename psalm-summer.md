**Psalm 138**
_Confitebor tibi_

1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with my **whole heart**; *
before the gods I will sing your **praise**.

2 I will bow down toward your holy temple
and praise your **Name**, *
because of your love and **faithfulness**;

3 For you have glorified your **Name** *
and your word above **all things**.

4 When I called, you **answered me**; *
you increased my strength with**in me**.

5 All the kings of the earth will praise you, O **Lord**, *
when they have heard the words of your **mouth**.

6 They will sing of the ways of the **Lord**, *
that great is the glory of the **Lord**.

7 Though the Lord be high, he cares for the **lowly**; *
he perceives the haughty from a**far**.

8 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you keep me **safe**; *
you stretch forth your hand against the fury of my enemies;
your right hand shall **save me**.

9 The Lord will make good his **purpose for me**; *
O Lord, your love endures for ever;
do not abandon the works of your **hands**.
