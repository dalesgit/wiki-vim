### Psalm 66:1-8

*Jubilate Deo*

1Â Be joyful in God, all you **lands**; *  
sing the glory of his Name;  
sing the glory of his **praise**.

2 Say to God, "How awesome are your **deeds**! *  
because of your great strength your enemies cringe be**fore you**.

3 All the earth bows down be**fore you**, *  
sings to you, sings out your **Name**."

4 Come now and see the works of **God**, *  
how wonderful he is in his doing toward all **people**.

5 He turned the sea into dry land,  
so that they went through the water on **foot**, *  
and there we re**joiced in him**.

6 In his might he rules for ever;  
his eyes keep watch over the **nations**; *  
let no rebel rise up a**gainst him**.

7 Bless our God, you **peoples**; *  
make the voice of his praise to be **heard**;

8 Who holds our souls in **life**, *  
and will not allow our feet to **slip**.
