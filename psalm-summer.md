### Psalm 37:1-12, 41-42

*Noli aemulari*

1 Do not fret yourself because of **evildoers**; *  
do not be jealous of those who do **wrong**.

2 For they shall soon wither like the **grass**, *  
and like the green grass fade a**way**.

3 Put your trust in the Lord and do **good**; *  
dwell in the land and feed on its **riches**.

4 Take delight in the **Lord**, *  
and he shall give you your heart's de**sire**.

5 Commit your way to the Lord and put your **trust in him**, *  
and he will bring it to **pass**.

6 He will make your righteousness as clear as the **light** *  
and your just dealing as the **noonday**.

7 Be still before the **Lord** *  
and wait patiently **for him**.

8 Do not fret yourself over the one who **prospers**, *  
the one who succeeds in evil **schemes**.

9 Refrain from anger, leave rage a**lone**; *  
do not fret yourself; it leads only to **evil**.

10 For evildoers shall be cut **off**, *  
but those who wait upon the Lord shall possess the **land**.

11 In a little while the wicked shall be no **more**; *  
you shall search out their place, but they will not **be there**.

12 But the lowly shall possess the **land**; *  
they will delight in abundance of **peace**.

41 But the deliverance of the righteous comes from the **Lord**; *  
he is their stronghold in time of **trouble**.

42 The Lord will help them and **rescue them**; *  
he will rescue them from the wicked and deliver them,  
because they seek refuge in **him**.
