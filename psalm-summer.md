**Psalm 29**
*Afferte Domino*

1 Ascribe to the Lord, you **gods**, *
ascribe to the Lord glory and **strength**.

2 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his **Name**; *
worship the Lord in the beauty of **holiness**.

3 The voice of the Lord is upon the waters;
the God of glory **thunders**; *
the Lord is upon the mighty **waters**.

4 The voice of the Lord is a **powerful voice**; *
the voice of the Lord is a voice of **splendor**.

5 The voice of the Lord breaks the **cedar trees**; *
the Lord breaks the cedars of **Lebanon**;

6 He makes Lebanon skip like a **calf**, *
and Mount Hermon like a young wild **ox**.

7 The voice of the Lord splits the flames of fire;
the voice of the Lord shakes the **wilderness**; *
the Lord shakes the wilderness of **Kadesh**.

8 The voice of the Lord makes the oak trees **writhe** *
and strips the forests **bare**.

9 And in the temple of the **Lord** *
all are crying, "**Glory**!"

10 The Lord sits enthroned above the **flood**; *
the Lord sits enthroned as King for ever**more.**

11 The Lord shall give strength to his **people**; *
the Lord shall give his people the blessing of **peace**.
