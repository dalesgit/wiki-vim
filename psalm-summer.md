### Psalm 16

*Conserva me, Domine*

1 Protect me, O God, for I take **refuge in you**; *  
I have said to the Lord, "You are my Lord,  
my good above all **other**."

2 All my delight is upon the godly that are in the **land**, *  
upon those who are noble among the **people**.

3 But those who run after **other gods** *  
shall have their troubles **multiplied**.

4 Their libations of blood I will not **offer**, *  
nor take the names of their gods upon my **lips**.

5 O Lord, you are my portion and my **cup**; *  
it is you who uphold my **lot**.

6 My boundaries enclose a **pleasant land**; *  
indeed, I have a goodly **heritage**.

7 I will bless the Lord who gives me **counsel**; *  
my heart teaches me, night after **night**.

8 I have set the Lord always be**fore me**; *  
because he is at my right hand I shall not **fall**.

9 My heart, therefore, is glad, and my spirit re**joices**; *  
my body also shall rest in **hope**.

10 For you will not abandon me to the **grave**, *  
nor let your holy one see the **Pit**.

11 You will show me the path of **life**; *  
in your presence there is fullness of joy,  
and in your right hand are pleasures for ever**more**.
