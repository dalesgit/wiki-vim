### Psalm 127

*Nisi Dominus*

1 Unless the Lord builds the **house**, *  
their labor is in vain who **build it**.

2 Unless the Lord watches over the city, *  
in vain the watchman keeps his vigil.

3 It is in vain that you rise so early and go to bed so late; *  
vain, too, to eat the bread of toil,  
for he gives to his beloved sleep.

4 Children are a heritage from the Lord, *  
and the fruit of the womb is a gift.

5 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior *  
are the children of one's youth.

6 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them! *  
he shall not be put to shame  
when he contends with his enemies in the gate.
