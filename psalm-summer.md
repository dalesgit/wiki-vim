### Psalm 33:12-22

Exultate, justi

12 Happy is the nation whose God is the **Lord**! *  
happy the people he has chosen to be his **own**!

13 The Lord looks down from **heaven**, *  
and beholds all the people in the **world**.

14 From where he sits enthroned he turns his **gaze** *  
on all who dwell on the **earth**.

15 He fashions all the hearts of **them** *  
and understands all their **works**.

16 There is no king that can be saved by a mighty **army**; *  
a strong man is not delivered by his great **strength**.

17 The horse is a vain hope for de**liverance**; *  
for all its strength it cannot **save**.

18 Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon those who **fear him**, *  
on those who wait upon his **love**,

19 To pluck their lives from **death**, *  
and to feed them in time of **famine**.

20 Our soul waits for the **Lord**; *  
he is our help and our **shield**.

21 Indeed, our heart rejoices in **him**, *  
for in his holy Name we put our **trust**.

22 Let your loving-kindness, O Lord, be up**on us**, *  
as we have put our trust in **you**.
