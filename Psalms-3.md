## Sunday evening, prayer one

### Psalm 122

With joy I heard them say,
"Let us go to the Lord's house."
With joy I heard them say,
"Let us go to the Lord's house!" And now, Jerusalem, we stand inside your gates.
Jerusalem, the city so built that city and temple are one.
To you the tribes go up, every tribe of the Lord.
It is the law of Israel to honor God's name.
The seats of law are here, the thrones of David's line.
Pray peace for Jerusalem: happiness for your homes, safety inside your walls, peace in your great houses.
For love of family and friends
I say, "Peace be with you!" For love of the Lord's own house I pray for your good. D

### Psalm 130

From morning watch until night, I waited for the Lord.
From the depths I call to you, Lord, hear my cry.
Catch the sound of my voice raised up, pleading.
If you record our sins, Lord, who could survive?
But because you forgive we stand in awe.
I trust in God's word, I trust in the Lord.
More than sentries for dawn
I watch for the Lord.
More than sentries for dawn let Israel watch.
The Lord will bring mercy and grant full pardon.
The Lord will free Israel from all its sins.

## Sunday morning prayer

### Psalm 118.

This is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad.
Give thanks, the Lord is good,
God's love is for ever!
Now let Israel say,
"God's love is for ever!"
Let the house of Aaron say,
"God's love is for ever!"
Let all who revere the Lord say,
"God's love is for ever!"
In distress I called to the Lord, who answered and set me free.
The Lord is with me, I fear not.
What can they do to me?
The Lord my help is with me, I can face my foes.
Better to trust in the Lord than rely on human help.
Better to trust in the Lord than rely on generous hearts.
The nations surrounded me; in God's name, I will crush them!
Surrounded me completely; in God's name, I will crush them!
Surrounded me like bees, blazed like brushwood fire; in God's name, I will crush them!
I was pushed to falling, but the Lord gave me help.
My strength, my song is the Lord, who has become my savior.
Glad songs of victory sound within the tents of the just.
With right hand raised high, the Lord strikes with force.
I shall not die but live to tell the Lord's great deeds.
The Lord punished me severely, but did not let me die.
Open the gates of justice, let me praise God within them.
This is the Lord's own gate, only the just will enter.
I thank you for you answered me, and you became my savior.
The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
This is the work of the Lord, how wonderful in our eyes.
This is the day the Lord made, let us rejoice and be glad.
Lord, give us the victory!
Lord, grant us success!
Blest is the one who comes,
who comes in the name of the Lord.
We bless you from the Lord's house.
The Lord God is our light: adorn the altar with branches.
I will thank you, my God, I will praise you highly.
Give thanks, the Lord is good, God's love is for ever! •

### Psalm 150

All that is alive, praise.
Praise God. Hallelujah!
Praise! Praise God in the temple, in the highest heavens!
Praise! Praise God's mighty deeds and noble majesty.
Praise! Praise God with trumpet blasts, with lute and harp.
Praise! Praise God with timbrel and dance, with strings and pipes.
Praise! Praise God with crashing cymbals, with ringing cymbals.
All that is alive, praise. Praise the Lord.
Hallelujah!o

## Sunday evening prayer 2

### Psalm 110

You are newborn like the dawn, fresh like the dew.
The Lord decrees to the king:
"Take the throne at my right hand, I will make your enemies a footrest.
I will raise your scepter over Zion and beyond, over all your enemies.
"Your people stand behind you on the day you take command.
You are made holy, splendid, newborn like the dawn, fresh like the dew."
God's oath is firm:
"You are a priest for ever, the rightful king by my decree." The Lord stands at your side to destroy kings on the day of wrath.
God executes judgment, crushes the heads of nations, and brings carnage worldwide.
The victor drinks from a wayside stream and rises refreshed. •

### Psalm 112

Happy are those who love God, a God of mercy and justice.
Happy those who love God and delight in the law.
Their children shall be blest, strong and upright in the land.
Their households thrive, their integrity stands firm.
A light shines on them in darkness, a God of mercy and justice.
The good lend freely and deal fairly, they will never stumble;
their justice shall be remembered.
Bad news holds no power, strong hearts trust God.
Steady and fearless,
they look down on their enemy.
They support the poor, their integrity stands firm, their strength brings them honor.
Hatred devours the wicked.
They grind their teeth; their hopes turn to ashes. •

## Monday morning prayer

### Psalm 90

Shine your love on us each dawn and gladden all our days.
You have been our haven, Lord, from generation to generation.
Before the mountains existed, before the earth was born, from age to age you are God.
You return us to dust, children of earth back to earth.
For in your eyes a thousand years are like a single day:
they pass with the swiftness of sleep.
You sweep away the years as sleep passes at dawn,
like grass that springs up in the day and is withered by evening.
For we perish at your wrath, your anger strikes terror.
You lay bare our sins
in the piercing light of your presence.
All our days wither beneath your glance, our lives vanish like a breath.
Our life is a mere seventy years, eighty with good health, and all it gives us is toil and distress;
then the thread breaks and we are gone.
Who can know the force of your anger?
Your fury matches our fear.
Teach us to make use of our days and bring wisdom to our hearts.
How long, O Lord, before you return?
Pity your servants,
shine your love on us each dawn, and gladden all our days.
Balance our past sorrows with present joys
and let your servants, young and old, see the splendor of your work.
Let your loveliness shine on us, and bless the work we do, bless the work of our hands. D

### Psalm 135:1-12

Praise the name of the Lord, you faithful servants gathered at God's house.
Praise the name of the Lord, give praise, faithful servants, who stand in the courtyard, gathered at God's house.
Sing hymns, for God is good.
Sing God's name, our delight, for the Lord chose Jacob, Israel as a special treasure.
I know the Lord is great, surpassing every little god.
What God wills, God does in heaven and earth, in the deepest sea.
God blankets earth with clouds, strikes lightning for the rain, releases wind from the storehouse.
God killed Egypt's firstborn, both humans and beasts, doing wondrous signs in Egypt against Pharoah and his aides.
God struck down nations, killed mighty kings,
Sihon, king of the Amorites, 0g, king of Bashan, all the kings of Canaan.
Then God gave Israel their land, a gift for them to keep.

## Monday evening prayer

### Psalm 136:1-9

Where charity and love are found, there is God.
Our God is good, give thanks!
God's love is for ever!
Our God of gods, give thanks!
God's love is for ever!
Our Lord of lords, give thanks!
God's love is for ever!
Alone the maker of worlds!
God's love is for ever!
Architect for the skies!
God's love is for ever!
Spread land on the sea!
God's love is for ever!
Set the great lights above!

God's love is for ever! 0

### Psalm 136:10-26

Great and wonderful are your deeds, Lord God almighty.
Struck down Egypt's firstborn!
God's love is for ever!
Guided Israel's escape!
God's love is for ever!
Held out a mighty arm!
God's love is for ever!
Split in two the Reed Sea!
God's love is for ever!
Led Israel across!
God's love is for ever!
Drowned Pharaoh and his troops!
God's love is for ever!
Led the desert trek!
God's love is for ever!
Struck down mighty tribes!
God's love is for ever!
Killed powerful kings!
God's love is for ever!
Sihon, the Amorite king!
God's love is for ever!
And Og, Bashan's king!
God's love is for ever!
Gave Israel a land!
God's love is for ever!
For Israel to keep!
God's love is for ever!
Remembered our distress!
God's love is for ever!
Kept us from defeat!
God's love is for ever!
God feeds all living things!
God's love is for ever!
God in heaven, be thanked!
God's love is for ever! •
