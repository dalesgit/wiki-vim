## Notes
- help us to do it gallantly, p. 461. Peter  prays it ea. Day, focusing on a phrase.
- _In the Morning_  This is another day, O Lord. I know not what it will bring  
forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I  am to stand up, help me to stand bravely. If I am to sit still,  help me to sit quietly. If I am to lie low, help me to do it  patiently. And if I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly. Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit  of Jesus.Â _Amen._
