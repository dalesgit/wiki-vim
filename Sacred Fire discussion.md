### Notes

- help us to do it gallantly, p. 461. Peter prays it ea. Day, focusing on a phrase.
- _In the Morning_ This is another day, O Lord. I know not what it will bring  
  forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I am to stand up, help me to stand bravely. If I am to sit still, help me to sit quietly. If I am to lie low, help me to do it patiently. And if I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly. Make these words more than words, and give me the Spirit of Jesus. _Amen._
- Karen Horney develops the difference individuation of girls vs. men
- _Raising Ophelia_ book that Miriam sent me.
- Tricia doesn't think there's that much different men and women
- Dora Lee was a Rockette. Spritely in spirit.
- Tara calls makeup "war paint"
- Carol Gilligan (Jim also new her in NY) cf. @UVLINVSV#Bass_2015 chapter on Women in Ministry [[Women and spiritual direction|Women and spiritual direction]]

### notes

- instead of taking them into the deep woods as previous cultures have done and initiating them into adulthood, we hold our collective breath and pray that they will make it through these tumultuous years intact, physically and morally. For the most part, we no longer have any meaningful initiation rites to help turn an adolescent into an adult.
- on screen man (Ed): sexuality is next door to breathing. He's 90 and trying to figure out what life's about. He is getting more out of our discussion of Rohlheiser (over Rohr which he read alone). He's going on 92. "My brain is young."
- Tara: young people "know loss". I heard her say "**know lost**" is a more energetic expression. I like.
- Chapter 2 observes the list of **struggles** of the human enterprise. The answer to the struggles, he way to respond to them, is the **big 4** elements of **essential discipleship**.
- (94) "Mature Discipleship is the struggle to give our lives away, after we have attained initial maturity. This generally constitutes the longest period of our lives, our “householder” years—those thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty years between landing solidly somewhere in adulthood and looking at retirement and what lies beyond. Our basic anxiety during these years needs to be around the questions: How do I do this better, more generously? How do I make a deeper, more life-giving contribution?"

- The situation of today’s Christians in our secularized cultures is basically the same: we are walking on the road to Emmaus, discouraged, our youthful faith crucified, talking with Christ, 98
- In the discouragement that ensues we will be tempted to walk away from our faith, our church, our hope, our Christ, and our God, toward some place of consolation. 102
- “Faith is rarely where your head is at. Nor is it where your heart is at. Faith is where your ass is at!” 106
- When that happens in our lives we will find ourselves, in terms of a gospel image, standing with Jesus inside pagan territory, talking to a Syrophoenician woman, and feeling torn between being a loyal child of our faith tradition and being a universal instrument of salvation for our God. 108
- Rather, Jesus’ concept of perfection is very much identified with compassion, so much so that sometimes the Gospels simply name it as compassion. Compassion is an attainable goal. Hence, Jesus challenges us: be compassionate as your heavenly father is compassionate. 117
- Love, understood properly, is never a reward for being good. Goodness, rather, is always a consequence of having been loved. We are not loved because we are good, but hopefully we become good as we experience love.
- Mostly, it is only in the face of mutual helplessness and sorrow, at a funeral or in the face of tragedy, that we are capable of forgetting our differences, putting away our outer garments, and seeing one another as brothers and sisters. 123
- There is an axiom attributed to Peter Maurin, the man who helped Dorothy Day found the Catholic Worker that goes something like this: “When you don’t know what else to do, keep going to meetings because Pentecost happened at a meeting!” 129
- This picture: a formerly confident but now somewhat deflated group of disciples are huddled together, confused and out of energy, needing to be recharged anew, unsure of what they are waiting for, but waiting nonetheless for something new to happen to them, for new fire, for a new vision and a new energy from beyond. 131
