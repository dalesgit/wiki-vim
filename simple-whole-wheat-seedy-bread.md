My mom used to make her own bread and yogurt from scratch.

I mean, come on. How cool is she?

I remember learning that and thinking my mom was the most awesome hippie mom ever and I wanted to do the same if I was ever a mama.

The bread-making season in our house ended sometime around the arrival of 10-pound me. But can you blame her? She had two babies to look after and who has time to make bread with so much life happening?

Well, the good news is, you **_do_** have time to make _this_ bread. I even speculate you could make it with a baby on your hip because it is literally a **dump, mix, rise and bake kind of bread**! Let’s get to baking!

This recipe is simple in both preparation and ingredients.

Just **9 basic ingredients** that are very forgiving. If you don’t have any of the seeds or oats on hand, just omit them! It’s still totally doable.

With a short **20-minute bake time**, hands on **prep time is only 15 minutes + the rise**! Hello, free time.

When I say dump, mix, rise, I mean it.

You literally dump the ingredients in a bowl, mix and let it do its thing in the fridge.

All that’s left to do is knead in the seedy and oat-y things and let it rise once more while the oven preheats.

Twenty minutes later and you have a perfectly delicious, seedy, whole grain loaf on your hands.

This loaf is magnificent; everything you want in a homemade bread. It’s:

Seriously simple  
Tender on the inside  
Crusty on the outside  
Loaded with whole grains  
Seedy  
Dreamy  
& Perfect


This makes the _perfect_ bread for [toast](https://minimalistbaker.com/15-vegan-protein-sources-easy-hummus-toast/), [sandwiches](https://minimalistbaker.com/chickpea-sunflower-sandwich/ "Chickpea Sunflower Sandwich"), [french toast](https://minimalistbaker.com/5-ingredient-vegan-banana-french-toast/), and everything in between.

I’ve been loving it with smashed avocado and a little [vegan parmesan cheese](https://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-vegan-parmesan-cheese/ "How To Make Vegan Parmesan Cheese") and hemp seeds, or with peanut butter and flax seed. You really can’t go wrong.

### Ingredients

-   1 1/2 cups warm water
-   3/4 Tbsp fast-acting yeast (1 packet yields ~3/4 Tbsp or 2 1/4 tsp)
-   2 Tbsp maple syrup, agave, or honey if not vegan
-   1/2 Tbsp salt
-   1 Tbsp flaxseed meal
-   2 cups [Bob’s Red Mill Whole-Wheat Pastry Flour](http://www.bobsredmill.com/whole-wheat_pastry-flour.html)
-   1 3/4 cups [Bob’s Red Mill Unbleached All-Purpose Flour](http://www.bobsredmill.com/unbleached-all-purpose-white-flour.html) (plus more for rolling / dusting)
-   2 Tbsp raw or roasted sunflower seeds
-   2 Tbsp rolled oats

### Instructions

-   Combine warm water (like bath water, or 110 degrees F / 43 C), yeast, maple syrup (or other sweetener), salt, flaxseed meal, and flours in a large mixing bowl and stir. The result will be a sticky, rough dough. If using a stand mixer, beat at medium speed for about a minute. Otherwise just use a spoon to stir until well combined and when it can no longer do the job, knead and turn it in the bowl with your hands. Add flour until the dough is no longer sticking to the sides – about 3 3/4 cups total (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
    
-   Lift the dough out and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover and let rise for 2 hours at room temperature and 2 hours in the fridge. Alternatively, if you only have 2 hours, let rise at room temperature and skip the fridge (though a longer rise is best).
    
-   Use fingers to create a small hole in the dough and pour in sunflower seeds and oats. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead about 20 turns or until elastic. Form into a loaf-like shape.
    
-   Place seam-side down in a lightly greased loaf pan or baking sheet and sift a light coating of flour over the top to help keep the dough moist. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 45-60 minutes.
    
-   Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C)\* toward the end of the dough resting time and place a metal or cast iron pan (**NOT glass, Pyrex, or ceramic**) on the lowest oven rack. Also have 1 cup of hot water ready.
    
-   When the oven is preheated, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut about ½-inch deep.
    
-   Place in oven on middle rack. Then carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Expect it to bubble and steam; then close oven door quickly.
    
-   Bake the bread for 26 to 35 minutes, or until deep golden brown and risen.
    
-   Remove the bread from the oven and let rest in the pan for 5 minutes. Then carefully remove from pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool. Let it cool completely before slicing for best results (otherwise it can be doughy in the middle).
    
-   Store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to a few days. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage.

### Notes

\*Based on some users’ experience, I lowered the baking temperature to 425\* F (from 450) to ensure the middle gets all the way done. I’ve had success at 450\* F, but it seems some people’s ovens or loaf pans are not allowing it to cook all the way through. This information was updated 3/15/16.
