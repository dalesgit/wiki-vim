## Sunday evening prayer 1

### Psalm 119-105-112

Your word is a lamp for my steps, a light for my path, hallelujah.
Your word is a lamp for my steps, a light for my path.
I have sworn firmly to uphold your just rulings.
I have suffered so much, give me the life you promise.
Receive, Lord, all that I say, and teach me your wisdom.
Though danger stalks,
I will never forget your law.
Though the wicked set traps, I will not stray from you.
Your laws are my heritage, the joy of my heart for ever.
I am determined to obey for a lasting reward. •

### Psalm 16

You show me the road to life: boundless joy at your side for ever, hallelujah.
Protect me, God, I turn to you for help.
I profess, "You are my Lord, my greatest good."
I once put faith in false gods, the idols of the land.
Now I make no offering to them, nor invoke their names.
Those who chase after them add grief upon grief.
Lord, you measure out my portion, the shape of my future;
you mark off the best place for me to enjoy my inheritance.
I bless God who teaches me, who schools my heart even at night.
I am sure God is here, right beside me.
I cannot be shaken.
So my heart rejoices, my body thrills with life, my whole being rests secure.
You will not abandon me to Sheol, nor send your faithful one to death.
You show me the road to life: boundless joy at your side for ever! O

## Sunday Morning Prayer

### Psalm 118

Blest is the one who comes,
who comes in the name of the Lord, hallelujah.
Give thanks, the Lord is good,
God's love is for ever!
Now let Israel say,
"God's love is for ever!"
Let the house of Aaron say,
"God's love is for ever!"
Let all who revere the Lord say,
"God's love is for ever!"
In distress I called to the Lord, who answered and set me free.
The Lord is with me, I fear not.
What can they do to me?
The Lord my help is with me, I can face my foes.
Better to trust in the Lord than rely on human help.
Better to trust in the Lord than rely on generous hearts.
The nations surrounded me; in God's name, I will crush them!
Surrounded me completely; in God's name, I will crush them!
Surrounded me like bees, blazed like brushwood fire; in God's name, I will crush them!
I was pushed to falling, but the Lord gave me help.
My strength, my song is the Lord, who has become my savior.
Glad songs of victory sound within the tents of the just.
With right hand raised high, the Lord strikes with force.
I shall not die but live to tell the Lord's great deeds.
The Lord punished me severely, but did not let me die.
Open the gates of justice, let me praise God within them.
This is the Lord's own gate, only the just will enter.
I thank you for you answered me, and you became my savior.
The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
This is the work of the Lord, how wonderful in our eyes.
This is the day the Lord made, let us rejoice and be glad.
Lord, give us the victory!
Lord, grant us success!
Blest is the one who comes, who comes in the name of the Lord, We bless you from the Lord's house.
The Lord God is our light: adorn the altar with branches.
I will thank you, my God, I will praise you highly.
Give thanks, the Lord is good, God's love is for ever! O

### Psalm 150

Praise! Praise God's mighty deeds and noble majesty, hallelujah!
Praise! Praise God in the temple, in the highest heavens!
Praise! Praise God's mighty deeds and noble majesty.
Praise! Praise God with trumpet blasts, with lute and harp.
Praise! Praise God with timbrel and dance, with strings and pipes.
Praise! Praise God with crashing cymbals, with ringing cymbals.
All that is alive, praise. Praise the Lord.
Hallelujah! •

### Palm 110

Christ the Lord is priest and king for ever, hallelujah.
The Lord decrees to the king:
"Take the throne at my right hand, I will make your enemies a footrest.
I will raise your scepter over Zion and beyond, over all your enemies.
"Your people stand behind you on the day you take command.
You are made holy, splendid, newborn like the dawn, fresh like the dew."
God's oath is firm:
"You are a priest for ever, the rightful king by my decree." The Lord stands at your side to destroy kings on the day of wrath.
God executes judgment, crushes the heads of nations, and brings carnage worldwide.
The victor drinks from a wayside stream and rises refreshed. •

### Psalm 115

God will bless all believers, the small and the great, hallelujah.
Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory, because of your love, because of your truth.
Why do the nations say,
"Where is their God?"
Our God is in the heavens and answers to no one.
Their gods are crafted by hand, mere silver and gold, with mouths that are mute and eyes that are blind, with ears that are deaf and noses that cannot smell.
Their hands cannot feel, their feet cannot walk, their throats are silent.
Their makers, their worshipers will be just like them.
Let Israel trust God, their help and shield.
Let the house of Aaron trust God, their help and shield.
Let all believers trust God, their help and shield.
The Lord has remembered us and will bless us,
will bless the house of Israel, will bless the house of Aaron.
God will bless all believers, the small and the great.
May God bless you more and more, bless all your children.
May you truly be blessed
by the maker of heaven and earth.
To the Lord belong the heavens, to us the earth below!
The dead sing no Hallelujah, nor do those in the silent ground.
But we will bless you, Lord, now and for ever.
Hallelujah!o

## Monday Morning Prayer

### Psalm 42

I thirst for God, the living stream.
When will I see God's face?
As a deer craves running water, I thirst for you, my God;
I thirst for God, the living God.
When will I see your face?
Tears are my steady diet.
Day and night I hear,
"Where is your God?"
I cry my heart out, I remember better days:
when I entered the house of God, I was caught in the joyful sound of pilgrims giving thanks.
Why are you sad, my heart?
Why do you grieve?
Wait for the Lord.
I will yet praise God my savior.
My heart is sad.
Even from Jordan and Hermon, from the peak of Mizar, I remember you.
There the deep roars to deep; your torrents crash over me.

The love God summoned by day sustained my praise by night, my prayer to the living God.
I complain to God, who I thought was rock:
"Why have you forgotten me?
Why am I bent double under the weight of enemies?

### Psalm 19:2-7

The sky tells the glory of God.
The sky tells the glory of God, tells the genius of God's work.
Day carries the news to day, night brings the message to night,
"Their insults grind me to dust.
Day and night they say, Where is your God?'" Why are you sad, my heart?
Why do you grieve?
Wait for the Lord.
I will yet praise God my savior. •
without a word, without a sound, without a voice being heard, yet their message fills the world, their news reaches its rim.
There God has pitched a tent for the sun to rest and rise renewed like a bridegroom rising from bed, an athlete eager to run the race.
It springs from the edge of the earth, runs a course across the sky to win the race at heaven's end.
Nothing on earth escapes its heat. •

## Monday evening prayer

### Psalm 45:2-10

Unrivaled in beauty, gracious in speech: how God has blessed you!
A great song fills my heart, I will recite it to the king, my tongue as skilled as the scribal pen.
Unrivaled in beauty, gracious in speech - how God has blessed you!
Hero, take up your sword, majestic in your armor.
Ride on for truth, show justice to the poor, wield your power boldly.
Your weapons are ready;
nations fall beneath your might, your enemies lose heart.
Your throne is as lasting as the everlasting God.
Integrity is the law of your land.
Because you love justice and hate evil, God, your God, anoints you above your peers with festive oil.
Your clothes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cinnamon flowers.
Music of strings welcomes you to the ivory palace and lifts your heart.
Royal women honor you.
On your right hand the queen, wearing gold of Ophir. n

### Psalm 45:11-18

The bridegroom is here; go out to welcome him.
Mark these words, daughter: leave your family behind, forget your father's house.
The king desires your beauty.
He is your lord.
Tyre comes with gifts, the wealthy honor you.
The robes of the queen are embroidered with gold.
In brilliant attire she is led to the king; her attendants follow.
In high spirits
they enter the royal palace.
Your sons will inherit the throne your fathers held.
They shall reign throughout the land.
Every age will recall your name.
This song will fix it in their memory. •
