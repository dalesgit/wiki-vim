## The Welcoming

> Various prayers adapted from the **New Zealand Prayer Book** and __The Book of Common Prayer__

> *When all are gathered, the Officiant says*

God our Father we thank you for Mary Jean, the years we shared with her, the good we saw in her, the love we received from her. We thank you that she is in your care and trust in your promise of eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen**.

Saint Paul said, 'I am convinced that there is nothing in death or life, in the realm of spirits or superhuman powers, in the world as it is or the world as it shall be, in the forces of the universe, in the heights or depths -- nothing in all creation that can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, our Lord. *Romans 8:38*


## The Commital 

> *All join in saying the following prayer*

**The Lord's Prayer**

Eternal Spirit, Earth-maker, Pain-bearer, Life-giver,\
Source of all that is and that shall be,\
Father and Mother of us all,\
Loving God, in whom is heaven:

The hallowing of your name echo through the universe!\
The way of your justice be followed by the peoples of the world!\
Your heavenly will be done by all created beings!\
Your commonwealth of peace and freedom\
sustain our hope and come on earth.

With the bread we need for today, feed us.\
In the hurts we absorb from one another, forgive us.\
In times of temptation and testing, strengthen us.\
From trials too great to endure, spare us.\
From the grip of all that is evil, free us.

For you reign in the glory of the power that is love,\
now and for ever. **Amen**

> *The Officiant prays*

We thank you, loving Creator, that we have been able to entrust Mary Jean into your keeping. Through Christ's victory we have hope in life
eternal. So now, we commit the ashes of her mortal body to their resting-place. **Amen**.

In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to Almighty God our sister Mary Jean, and we commit her body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The Lord bless her and keep her, the Lord make his face to shine upon her and be gracious to her, the Lord lift up his countenance upon her and give her peace. **Amen**.

> *The ashes are placed in their resting place.*

## The Prayers

> *The Officiant says* 

Father of all, we pray to you for those we love but see no longer.  We thank you for the peace and light you bestow upon them; in your loving wisdom and almighty power continue to work in them the good purpose of your perfect will, through Jesus Christ our Lord.  **Amen.**

God of heaven and earth, help us to entrust our loved ones to your care.  When sorrow darkens our lives, teach us to look to you.  May we on earth always rejoice in your presence, and share with them the rest and peace you give, in Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**

Father, accept our praise and thanksgiving for the lives of all your faithful people who have served you on earth and are now at rest. Grant that we too may dedicate ourselves to your service, following their good examples, and share with them your heavenly kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. **Amen.**

May the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant: Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight; through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. **Amen**.

> *The people say together*

**The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all. Amen.**

__Celestial Music__

[ … ]

In reality, we sit by the side of the road, watching the sun set;\
from time to time, the silence pierced by a birdcall.\
It’s this moment we’re both trying to explain, the fact\
that we’re at ease with death, with solitude.\
My friend draws a circle in the dirt; inside, the caterpillar doesn’t move.\
She’s always trying to make something whole, something beautiful, an image\
capable of life apart from her.\
We’re very quiet. It’s peaceful sitting here, not speaking, the composition\
fixed, the road turning suddenly dark, the air\
going cool, here and there the rocks shining and glittering–\
it’s this stillness that we both love.\
The love of form is a love of endings.
