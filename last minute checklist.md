Pack properly.

Bring your travel and health insurance information and have it handy at all times. In the event of unexpected travel delays and emergencies, pack enough prescription medication for at least 2 weeks beyond the length of your travel itinerary. Keep it with you at all times and if possible, leave all medication in its original container, and carry a list of the prescription names, dosage amounts and times taken for all medications. It is also a good idea to bring your prescription for eye glasses or contacts. 

Both casual and dressy attire will be essential during your cruise. For more detailed information, please see the PACKING ADVICE AND CLOTHING sections.

Leave copies of your passport, electronic airline tickets, traveler checks and any credit cards you plan to use with a family member or trusted friend.

Inform your bank or credit card company that you are traveling abroad to avoid any challenges with using your credit card on the cruise

Distribute your ship phone number to friends and relatives.

Place a card with your name and address inside your baggage, as well as on the outside.
Have the post office hold your mail. Also, stop your newspaper delivery or have a friend or neighbor take them in for you.
