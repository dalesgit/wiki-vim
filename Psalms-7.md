## Wednesday morning prayer

### Psalm 36

God, you are the fount of life, you give us light and we see.
Sin whispers with the wicked, shares its evil, heart to heart.
These sinners shut their eyes to all fear of God.
They refuse to see their sin, to know it and hate it.
Their words ring false and empty, their plans neglect what is good.
They daydream of evil, plot their crooked ways, seizing on all that is vile.
Your mercy, Lord, spans the sky; your faithfulness soars among the clouds.
Your integrity towers like a mountain; your justice runs deeper than the sea.
Lord, you embrace all life:
How we prize your tender mercy!
God, your people seek shelter, safe in the warmth of your wings.
They feast at your full table, slake their thirst in your cool stream, for you are the fount of life, you give us light and we see.
Grant mercy always to your own, victory to honest hearts.
Keep the proud from trampling me, assaulting me with wicked hands.
Let those sinners collapse, struck down, never to rise.

### Psalm 47

Sing out your praise to God, to the king, sing out your praise.
All peoples, clap your hands, shout your joy to God.
For God Most High is awesome, great king of all the earth.
The One who conquers peoples and sets them at our feet chooses for beloved Jacob a land to be our pride.
God ascends the mountain to cheers and trumpet blasts.
Sing out your praise to God, to the king, sing out your praise.
For God rules the earth; sing praise with all your skill.
God rules over nations, high on the sacred throne.
Foreign rulers join
the people of Abraham's God; all the powers on earth belong to God on high. •

## Wednesday evening prayer

### Psalm 27:1-6

The Lord is my saving light; whom should I fear?
The Lord is my saving light; whom should I fear?
God is my fortress; what should I dread?
When the violent come at me to eat me alive,
a mob eager to kill - they waver, they collapse.
Should battalions lay siege, I will not fear;
should war rage against me, even then I will trust.
One thing I ask the Lord, one thing I seek:
to live in the house of God every day of my life, caught up in God's beauty, at prayer in his temple.
The Lord will hide me there, hide my life from attack: a sheltering tent above me, a firm rock below.
I am now beyond reach of those who besiege me.
In his temple I will offer a joyful sacrifice,
I will play and sing to God. •

### Psalm 27:7-14

I look for your face, O God, I beg you not to hide.
O God, listen to me; be gracious, answer me.
Deep within me a voice says,
"Look for the face of God!"
So I look for your face, I beg you not to hide.
Do not shut me out in anger, help me instead.
Do not abandon or desert me, my savior, my God.
If my parents rejected me, still God would take me in.
Teach me how to live, lead me on the right road away from my enemies.
Do not leave me to their malice; liars breathing violence rise to swear against me.
I know I will see how good God is while I am still alive.
Trust in the Lord. Be strong.
Be brave. Trust in the Lord. o

## Thursday Morning Prayer

### Psalm 57

Awake, my harp and lyre, so I can wake up the dawn!
Care for me, God, take care of me, I have nowhere else to hide.
Shadow me with your wings until all danger passes.
I call to the Most High, to God, my avenger:
send help from heaven to free me, punish those who hound me.
Extend to me, O God, your love that never fails, for I find myself among lions who crave for human flesh, their teeth like spears and arrows, their tongues sharp as swords.
O God, rise high above the heavens!
Spread your glory across the earth!
They rigged a net for me, a trap to bring me down; they dug a pit for me, but they — they fell in!
I have decided, O God, my decision is firm:
to you I will sing my praise.
Awake, my soul, to song!
Awake, my harp and lyre, so I can wake up the dawn!
I will lift my voice in praise, sing of you, Lord, to all nations.
For your love reaches heaven's edge, your unfailing love, the skies.
O God, rise high above the heavens!
Spread your glory across the earth! •

### Psalm 48

In your temple, Lord, we recall your constant love.
Our great Lord deserves great praise in the city of God:
Holy mountain, beautiful height, crown of the earth!
Zion, highest of sacred peaks, city of the Great King!
God enthroned in its palaces becomes our sure defense!
Watch the foreign kings massing to attack; seeing what they face, they flee in terror.
Trembling grips them, anguish like childbirth, fury like an east wind shattering a merchant fleet.
What we see
matches what we were told,
"This is the city the Lord protects; our God is strong for ever." In your temple, Lord, we recall your constant love.
Your praise, like your name, fills the whole world.
Your right hand holds the victory.
Mount Zion and the cities of Judah rejoice at your justice.
March around Zion, make the circuit, count each tower.
Ponder these walls, observe these citadels,
so you may tell your children:
"Here is God!
Our God for ever!
God who leads us even against death!" •

## Thursday evening prayer

### Psalm 30

How I begged and you healed me, God; for ever I will thank you.
I give you high praise, for you, Lord, raised me up above my gloating enemy.
Lord, how I begged you, and you, God, healed me.
You pulled me from the pit, brought me back from Sheol.
Celebrate, all you saints, praise this awesome God, whose anger passes quickly, whose mercy lasts a lifetime - as laughter fills a day after one brief night of tears.
When all was going well, I thought I could never fall; with God's powerful blessing, I would stand like a mountain!
Then you hid your face;
I shook with fear!
I cried out, "Lord, Lord!" I begged, I pleaded:
"What good is my blood to you?
Why push me down the pit?
Can dead bones praise you, recount your unbroken love?
Listen to me, O God, turn and help me now."
You changed my anguish into this joyful dance, pulled off my sackcloth, gave me bright new robes, that my life might sing your glory, never silent in your praise.
For ever I will thank you,
O Lord my God. •

### Psalm 32

Happy the pardoned,
in whom God finds no evil, no deceit.
Happy the pardoned, whose sin is canceled, in whom God finds no evil, no deceit.
While I hid my sin, my bones grew weak from endless groaning.
Day and night,
under the weight of your hand, my strength withered as in a summer drought.
Then I stopped hiding my sin and spoke out,
"God, I confess my wrong." And you pardoned me.
No wonder the faithful pray to you in danger!
Even a sudden flood will never touch them.
You, my shelter,
you save me from ruin.
You encircle me with songs of freedom.
"I show you the path to walk.
As your teacher, I watch out for you.
"Do not be a stubborn mule, needing bridle and bit to be tamed." Evil brings grief;
trusting in God brings love.
Rejoice in the Lord.
Be glad and sing, you faithful and just. •

## Friday morning prayer

### Psalm 51

In your love make Zion lovely.
Have mercy, tender God, forget that I defied you.
Wash away my sin, cleanse me from my guilt.
I know my evil well, it stares me in the face, evil done to you alone before your very eyes.
How right your condemnation!
Your verdict clearly just.
You see me for what I am, a sinner before my birth.
You love those centered in truth; teach me your hidden wisdom.
Wash me with fresh water, wash me bright as snow.
Fill me with happy songs,
let the bones you bruised now dance.
Shut your eyes to my sin, make my guilt disappear.
Creator, reshape my heart, God, steady my spirit.
Do not cast me aside stripped of your holy spirit.
Save me, bring back my joy, support me, strengthen my will.
Then I will teach your way and sinners will turn to you.
Help me, stop my tears, and I will sing your goodness.
Lord, give me words
and I will shout your praise.
When I offer a holocaust, the gift does not please you.
So I offer my shattered spirit; a changed heart you welcome.
In your love make Zion lovely, rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
Then sacrifice will please you, young bulls upon your altar.

### Psalm 100

Serve the Lord with gladness, enter God's presence with joy!
Shout joy to the Lord, all earth, serve the Lord with gladness, enter God's presence with joy!
Know that the Lord is God, our maker to whom we belong, our shepherd, and we the flock.
Enter the temple gates,
the courtyard with thanks and praise; give thanks and bless God's name.
Indeed the Lord is good!
God's love is for ever, faithful from age to age.

## Friday evening prayer

### Psalm 41

Blest are those ready to help the poor; in hard times God repays their care.
God watches, protects, blesses them in their land, lets no enemy swallow them up!
God comforts them on their sickbed and nurses them to health.
I said, "God, pity me,
heal me for I have failed you."
Enemies predict the worst for me:
"How soon till this one dies, how soon forgotten?"
Visitors all wish me well, but they come seeking bad news to gossip on the street.
My enemies whisper
and spread the worst about me:
"Something fatal has taken hold, this one will not get well."
Even my trusted friend who used to eat with me now turns on me.

## Saturday morning prayer

### Psalm 119:145-152

I face you in the cold night, praying, waiting for your word.
My heart begs you, Lord: hear me, so I can keep faith.
I beg you, make me free, so I can live your laws.
I face you in the cold night praying, waiting for your word.
I keep watch through the night, repeating what you promise.
Hear me, loving God,
let your justice make me live.
The wicked close in on me; to them your law is foreign.
But you, Lord, are closer still, your law is my whole truth, learned when I was young' fixed for all time. •

### Psalm 117

Praise, give glory to God!
Nations, peoples, give glory!
Praise! Give glory to God!
Nations, peoples, give glory!
Strong the love embracing us.
Faithful the Lord for ever.
Hallelujah!
