**King Alfred the Great, King of Wessex**

Alfred the Great's Feast Day is celebrated on October 26th.

King Alfred, who lived from 849-899, was the son of the ruling king of Wessex, one of the small kingdoms that eventually became England. He had three older brothers so it was never anticipated that Alfred would ever be king, except that he lived during the time when the Vikings were invading the island.His father was killed while defending the kingdom, and his three brothers ruled successively, and were killed as well.Alfred came to the throne in 871, and in 875, beat back an attack on England from the Danes.After their loss, the Danes attacked again in 876, 877 and 878, when Alfred finally defeated them.As part of their peace agreement with Alfred, the Dane's leader, Guthrum, agreed to be baptized. Alfred stood as his Godfather.

A man born at a time of crisis, Alfred was called to a task that would have been regarded as too much for any one person.As a king, he fulfilled his duty by fighting for his people, working for peace where he could, and nurturing people when the days of war were over.He went above and beyond what the world called him to do and listened to a higher calling through his vocation as king, a call from God not only to protect but also to heal; not only to fight but to be concerned with what happens when the fighting ends; not only to give out laws and decrees for the betterment of his people, but also to practice what he preached.

Alfred earned the title "the Great" by his multiple contributions to English life in the areas of education, law, and religion.He was known to be an extremely devout Christian and very knowledgeable in Christian history and tradition.He translated the work of Pope Gregory the Great on pastoral care, and the *Ecclesiastical History of the English People* by the Venerable Bede, which is readily available to this day. He also appointed well qualified abbots and bishops and took the spiritual care of his subjects very seriously, though he was, on the whole, a secular man.It is because of his work in the areas of religion and education, as well as helping to unify England that, although never having been "made" a saint, Alfred is commemorated as a Saint by both the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church.

> Sovereign Lord, you brought your servant Alfred to a troubled throne that he might establish peace in a ravaged land and revive learning and the arts among the people:Awake in us also a keen desire to increase our understanding while we are in this world, and an eager longing to reach that endless life where all will be made clear; through Jesus Christ out Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. **Amen**.
