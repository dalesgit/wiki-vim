### How to Make Simple White Bread

After you make a loaf of this Simple White Bread, you will make sure you have enough ingredients to at least double the recipe next time. And, it’s easy enough that your kids could help with the measuring and kneading of the dough. The only hard part about this recipe is the waiting to bake the loaf of bread. You do need to let the dough rest in the refrigerator overnight before baking it.

To prepare the dough, begin by adding the sugar and yeast to a cup of warm water and set it aside. Next, in a medium bowl (or a large bowl if doubling or tripling the recipe), mix together the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture and stir everything together.

Get a work surface ready by sprinkling a couple of tablespoons of flour on it. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic. Then, place the kneaded dough into a large plastic zip bag that has been drizzled with olive oil. Make sure you get all the dough covered in the oil. Seal the plastic bag and store it in the refrigerator overnight.

## How to Bake Simple White Bread

The next day, when you are ready to bake the bread after letting the dough rest in the refrigerator, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Keep the dough in the plastic zipped bag as you let it come to room temperature.
After about an hour, sprinkle some more flour (1-2 tablespoons) of flour onto your work surface. Take the dough out of the plastic bag and knead and fold the dough for about a minute.
Form the dough into a log that will fit into a greased 8-inch loaf pan.
Cover the dough after you have placed it in the loaf pan, and let it rise until it is almost double in size (about 2 hours). I just used the plastic zip bag to cover the dough, and it worked great!
After the dough has risen, slash the dough with a sharp knife and bake it for 35-40 minutes at 350°F. To be precise, the internal temperature of the bread should be 190-210°F.
Let it cool before slicing. Enjoy!

* If you are using Rapid Rise add the yeast to the DRY ingredients, then slowly incorporate the wet ingredients to the dry. Follow the rest of the directions from #4 on.

### Notes

**Flour:** Bread flour or all-purpose can both be used with no changes to the recipe. Bread flour will produce a slightly chewier loaf. Whole wheat flour can’t be substituted cup-for-cup because it’s gluten levels are different. Here is my favorite [Whole Wheat Bread recipe](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/honey-whole-wheat-bread/).

**Yeast:** to substitute Instant or Rapid Rise yeast, skip the “proofing” of the dough in the first step and add the yeast to the bowl with step 2. Allow the dough to complete its first rise, and then roll and shape into loaves and rise again (rise times will be much faster with instant yeast). 

**Quick-rise Tip:** To speed up the rising time of the first rise, make dough up to first rising, placing it in a well greased bowl, turning it once to grease the dough all over. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Preheat oven to 180 degrees F, then *turn oven off.* Place bowl into the oven, leaving the oven door slightly cracked open. Allow to rise until doubled. Then remove, punch down and shape into loaves.

**To make ahead:** Make the bread dough through step 4, before the first rise. Place in a large airtight container, and refrigerate for up to one day. Remove from fridge and allow to come to room temperature. Proceed with punching down and forming loaves.

**Freezing Instructions:**
To freeze the dough: Prepare the recipe through step (6), before the second rise. Place the shaped loaves into a freezer-safe or disposable aluminum bread pan. Cover tightly with a double layer of aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to bake, allow the loaves to thaw and complete the second rise, at room temperature (about 5 hours). Bake as directed.
To freeze baked bread: Allow baked bread to cool completely. Place each loaf in a freezer-safe resealable bag and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature on the countertop, or overnight in the refrigerator.

**Bread Machine:** If using a bread machine, you may want to cut this recipe in half to make 1 loaf (depending on the capacity of your machine).

tried: 12/13/24: I added a half dozen or so tablespoons flour in the first knead. Used honey instead of sugar.
12/22/24: made with 3 + ca 1/4 cup flour. Then still added ca. 6 T in the kneading.
