I tried to call you yesterday, but I got your voicemail, so I wanted to make sure that I reach out to you via email as well. I wanted to let you know that the wire you tried to send recently has been returned, and the reasons that I was given for it being returned was that they were unable to locate the beneficiary’s name and the account number was invalid. I know you said that you confirmed the wire instructions, but please make sure that you have the exact name as listed on the beneficiary’s account as titled at their institution along with a valid account number for that institution.

Thankfully this wire was returned back to your account, but it’s possible that once we send a wire that we may not be able to recover those funds, I would recommend to be absolutely positive about the wiring instructions as they are crucial to the wiring process and make certain that those wiring instructions are legitimate and that you got a verbal confirmation from the person that you are trying to send the funds to.

If you have any questions, you are more than welcome to come into the branch or call me at 813-749-2731.

Thank you,
