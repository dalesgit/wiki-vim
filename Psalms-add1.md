Midday
Psalm 23
The Lord is my shepherd, I need nothing more.

You give me rest in green meadows, setting me near calm waters, where you revive my spirit.

You guide me along sure paths, you are true to your name.

Though I should walk in death's dark valley,

I fear no evil with you by my side, your shepherd's staff to comfort me.

You spread a table before me as my foes look on.

You soothe my head with oil; my cup is more than full.

Goodness and love will tend me every day of my life.

I will dwell in the house of the Lord as long as I shall live. •

Psalm 25
Lord, I give myself to you.

I trust you, God; do not fail me, nor let my enemies gloat.

No one loyal is shamed, but traitors know disgrace.

Teach me how to live, Lord, show me the way.

Steer me toward your truth, you, my saving God, you, my constant hope.

Recall your tenderness, your lasting love.

Remember me, not my faults, the sins of my youth.

To show your own goodness, God, remember me.

Good and just is the Lord, guiding those who stray.

God leads the poor, pointing out the path.

God's ways are faithful love for those who keep the covenant.

Be true to your name, O Lord, forgive my sin, though great.

Do you respect God?

Then God will guide your choice.

Your life will be full, your heirs will keep the land.

God befriends the faithful teaches them the covenant.

I keep looking to God to spring me from this trap.

Turn, treat me as your friend, I am empty and poor.

Release my trapped heart, free me from my anguish.

See my misery, my pain, take my sins away.

See how they mob me, this crowd that hates me.

Protect me and save my life.

Keep me from disgrace, for I take shelter in you.

Let integrity stand guard as I wait for you.

Free Israel, O God, from all its troubles.

Psalm 34

I will never stop thanking God, with constant words of praise.

My soul will boast of God; the poor will hear me and be glad.

Join me in praising the Lord, together tell of God's name.

I asked and the Lord responded, freed me from all my fears.

Turn to God, be bright with joy; you shall never be let down.

I begged and God heard, took my burdens from me.

God's angel defends the faithful, guards them on every side.

Drink in the richness of God, enjoy the strength of the Lord.

Live in awe of God, you saints: you will want for nothing.

Even if lions go hungry, those seeking God are fed.

Come to me, children, listen: learn to cherish the Lord.

Do you long for life, for time to enjoy success?

Keep your tongue from evil, keep lies far from your lips.

Shun evil, go after good, press on, seek after peace.

God confronts the wicked to blot them out for ever, but turns toward the just to hear their cry for help.

The troubled call out; God hears, saves them from all distress.

God stays near broken hearts, heals the wounded spirit.

The good endure great trials, but God comes to their rescue and guards their every bone so not one is broken.

Evil kills its own kind, dooms the wicked to death.

God saves those who keep faith;

no trusting soul is doomed.

Psalm 71

Lord, you are my shelter, do not fail me.

You always do right; deliver me, rescue me, hear me and save me.

Be my rock and haven, to whom I can always turn; be my tower of strength, keep me safe.

The ruthless and wicked trap me; reach out to free me.

You are my hope, O Lord, from the days of my youth.

I have relied on you since birth, my strength from my mother's womb;

I will praise you always.

I am shunned like the plague, but you keep me in your care.

I am filled with your praises, all day I sing your glory.

Now I am old, my strength fails, do not toss me aside.

My enemies scheme against me, they have designs on my life.

They think God has left me.

"Strike," they say, "no one will help."

Do not hold back, Lord, run to my rescue.

Disgrace my accusers, wrap them in shame, make my enemies face utter ruin.

I will not lose hope, never stop praising you.

My lips speak your goodness, praise each day your saving acts, though I cannot count them all.

I will enter your palace proclaiming,

"Lord God, you alone are just."

From childhood till now

you taught me to praise your wonders.

Do not leave me, Lord, now that I am old.

I can still recount to a new generation your power and strength.

Your goodness is boundless, your works so great; who can equal you?

You wrack me with torment, but you give back my life and raise me from this grave.

You will restore my honor and wrap me again in mercy.

I will thank you, Lord, for your true friendship

and play the lyre and harp for you, to the Holy One of Israel.

I will sing out with joy, sing of how you saved me.

From morning till night

I will trumpet your goodness; those who sought my ruin are defeated and shamed.

Psalm 102

Hear my prayer, Lord, let my cry reach you.

Do not turn from me in my hour of need.

When I call, listen, answer me at once.

For my days dissolve like smoke, my bones are burned to ash.

My heart withers away like grass.

I even forget to eat, so consumed am I with grief.

My skin hangs on my bones.

Like a gull lost in the desert, like an owl haunting the ruins, I keep a solitary watch, a lone bird on a roof.

All day my enemies mock me, they make my name a curse.

For bread, I eat ashes, tears salt my drink.

You lifted me up in anger and threw me to the ground.

My days pass into evening, I wither like the grass.

But you, Lord, preside for ever, every age remembers you.

Rise with mercy for Zion, for now is the time for pity.

Your servants treasure every stone, they cherish even the rubble.

Nations will fear your name, your glory will humble kings.

When you rebuild Zion's walls, you will appear in glory, Lord.

You hear the homeless pleading and do not mock their prayer.

Write this down for those to come, a people created to praise our God:

"The Lord watches from on high, searches the earth from heaven.

"God hears the prisoner's groan and sets the doomed free to sing the Lord's name in Zion, God's praise in Jerusalem.

There the nations and peoples gather to serve the Lord."

God has broken me in my prime, has cut short my days.

I say: "My God, do not take me.

My life is only half-spent, while you live from age to age."

Long ago you made the earth, the heavens, too, are your work.

Should they decay, you remain.

Should they wear out like a robe, like clothing changed and thrown away, you are still the same.

Your years will never end.

May your servants' line last for ever, our children grow strong before you.

Psalm 104

I will bless you, Lord my God!

You fill the world with awe.

You dress yourself in light, in rich, majestic light.

You stretched the sky like a tent, built your house beyond the rain.

You ride upon the clouds, the wind becomes your wings, the storm becomes your herald, your servants, bolts of light.

You made the earth solid, fixed it for good.

You made the sea a cloak, covering hills and all.

At your command

the sea fled your thunder, swept over mountains, down the valleys to its place.

You set its limits,

never to drown the earth again.

You feed springs that feed brooks, rushing down ravines, water for wild beasts, for wild asses to drink.

Birds nest nearby

and sing among the leaves.

You drench the hills with rain from high heaven.

You nourish the earth with what you create.

You make grass grow for cattle, make plants grow for people, food to eat from the earth and wine to warm the heart, oil to glisten on faces and bread for bodily strength.

In Lebanon God planted trees, the flourishing cedar.

Sparrows nest in the branches, the stork in treetops.

High crags for wild goats, rock holes for badgers.

Your moon knows when to rise, your sun when to set.

Your darkness brings on night when wild beasts prowl.

The young lions roar to you in search of prey.

They slink off to dens to rest at daybreak, then people rise to work until the daylight fades.

God, how fertile your genius!

You shape each thing, you fill the world with what you do.

I watch the sea, wide and deep, filled with fish, large and small, with ships that ply their trade, and your own toy, Leviathan.

All look to you for food when they hunger;

you provide it and they feed.

You open your hand, they feast; you turn away, they fear.

You steal their breath, they drop back into dust.

Breathe into them, they rise; the face of the earth comes alive!

Let God's glory endure

and the Lord delight in creating.

One look from God, earth quivers; one touch, and mountains erupt.

I will sing to my God, make music for the Lord as long as I live.

Let my song give joy to God who is a joy to me.

Rid the world of sinners, rid it of evil!

I will bless you, Lord!

Hallelujah! •

Psalm 128

How good to revere the Lord, to walk in God's path.

Your table rich from labor — how good for you!

Your beloved, a fruitful vine in the warmth of your home.

Like olive shoots, children surround your table.

This is your blessing when you revere the Lord.

May the Lord bless you from Zion!

May you see Jerusalem prosper every day of your life.

May you see your children's children, and on Israel, peace! •
