# Night Prayer
## Psalm 4
Answer when I call, faithful God.
You cleared away my trouble; be good to me, listen to my prayer.
How long, proud fools, will you insult my honor, loving lies and chasing shadows?
Look! God astounds believers, the Lord listens when I call.
Tremble, but do not despair.
Attend to your heart, be calm through the night, worship with integrity, trust in the Lord.
Cynics ask, "Who will bless us?
Even God has turned away." You give my heart more joy than all their grain and wine.
I sleep secure at night, you keep me in your care. D
## Psalm 31
Shelter me, Lord, save me from shame.
Let there be justice:
save me!
Help me! Listen!
Be quick to the rescue!
Be my fortress, my refuge.
You, my rock and fortress, prove your good name.
Guide me, lead me, free me from their trap.
You are my shelter;
I put myself in your hands, knowing you will save me,
Lord God of truth.
You hate the slaves of idols, but I trust in you.
I dance for joy at your constant love.
You saw me suffer, you know my pain.
You let no enemy cage me, but set my feet on open ground.
Pity me, Lord, I hurt all over;
my eyes are swollen, my heart and body ache.
Grief consumes my life, sighs fill my days;
guilt saps my strength, my bones dissolve.
Enemies mock me,
make me the butt of jokes.
Neighbors scorn me, strangers avoid me.
Forgotten like the dead, I am a shattered jar.
I hear the crowd whisper,
"Attack on every side!"
as they scheme to take my life.
But I trust in you, Lord.
I say, "You are my God, My life is in your hands." Snatch me from the enemy, ruthless in their chase.
Look on me with love, save your servant.
I call on you;
save me from shame!
Shame the guilty,
silence them with the grave.
Silence the lips that lie, that scorn the just.
How rich your goodness to those who revere you!
The whole world can see: whoever seeks your help finds how lavish you are.
You are shelter from gossips, a place to hide from busy tongues.
Blessed be the Lord!
God's love encircles me like a protecting wall.
I said too quickly,
"God has cut me off!"
But you heard my cry when I prayed for help.
Love the Lord, all faithful people, the Lord your guardian, who fully repays the proud.
Be strong, be brave, all who wait for God. •
## Psalm 88
Save me, Lord my God!
By day, by night, I cry out.
Let my prayer reach you; turn, listen to me.
I am steeped in trouble, ready for the grave.
I am like one destined for the pit, a warrior deprived of strength, forgotten among the dead, buried with the slaughtered for whom you care no more.
You tossed me to the bottom of the pit, into its murky darkness, your anger pulled me down like roaring waves.
You took my friends away, disgraced me before them.
Trapped here with no escape, I cannot see beyond my pain.
Lord, I cry out to you all day, my hands keep reaching out.
Do you work marvels for the dead?
Can shadows rise and sing praise?
Is your mercy sung in the grave, your lasting love in Sheol?
Are your wonders known in the pit? your justice, in forgotten places?
But I cry out to you, God, each morning I plead with you.
Why do you reject me, Lord?
Why do you hide your face?
Weak since childhood, I am often close to death.
Your torments track me down, your rage consumes me, your trials destroy me.
All day, they flood around me, pressing down, closing me in.
You took my friends from me, darkness is all I have left. •
## Psalm 91
All you sheltered by the Most High, who live in Almighty God's shadow, say to the Lord, "My refuge, my fortress, my God in whom I trust!"
God will free you from hunters' snares, will save you from deadly plague, will cover you like a nesting bird.
God's wings will shelter you.
No nighttime terror shall you fear, no arrows shot by day, no plague that prowls the dark, no wasting scourge at noon.
A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand.
But you shall live unharmed:
God is sturdy armor.
You have only to open your eyes to see how the wicked are repaid.
You have the Lord as refuge, have made the Most High your stronghold.
No evil shall ever touch you, no harm come near your home.
God instructs angels
to guard you wherever you go.
With their hands they support you, so your foot will not strike a stone.
You will tread on lion and viper, trample tawny lion and dragon.
"I deliver all who cling to me, raise the ones who know my name, answer those who call me, stand with those in trouble.
These I rescue and honor, satisfy with long life,
and show my power to save."
## Psalm 103
My soul, bless the Lord, bless God's holy name!
My soul, bless the Lord, hold dear all God's gifts!
Bless God, who forgives your sin and heals every illness, who snatches you from death and enfolds you with tender care, who fills your life with richness and gives you an eagle's strength.
The Lord, who works justice and defends the oppressed, teaches Moses and Israel divine ways and deeds.
The Lord is tender and caring, slow to anger, rich in love.
God will not accuse us long, nor bring our sins to trial, nor exact from us in kind what our sins deserve.
As high as heaven above earth, so great is God's love for believers.
As far as east from west, so God removes our sins.
As tender as father to child, so gentle is God to believers.
The Lord knows how we are made, remembers we are dust.
Our days pass by like grass, our prime like a flower in bloom.
A wind comes, the flower goes, empty now its place.
God's love is from all ages, God's justice beyond all time for believers of each generation: those who keep the covenant, who take care to live the law.
The Lord reigns from heaven, rules over all there is.
Bless the Lord, you angels, strong and quick to obey, attending to God's word.
Bless the Lord, you powers, eager to serve God's will.
Bless the Lord, you creatures, everywhere under God's rule.
My soul, bless the Lord! 0
## Psalm 134
Bless the Lord,
all who serve in God's house, who stand watch throughout the night.
Lift up your hands in the holy place and bless the Lord.
And may God,
the maker of earth and sky, bless you from Zion. o
