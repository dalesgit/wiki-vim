*Reflection for Spiritual Direction Course*

1. **I notice…(awareness)**: I get upset, angry, shutdown -- when [MP](MP.md) 1) is controlling, 2) doesn't listen, 3) makes assumptions about what I want.
2. **I’m curious about… (attentive exploration)**: Do I want to find my own calm place? Or do I want an appropriate response to MP? This morning I started to respond, but she shut me off. (see below)
3. **I wonder how I can… (active response)**: I said:
    You could help me to know how to respond when you … 
    When you complain (about DOK), are you:
        looking for a response from me?
        looking for a sympathetic ear but not feedback?
        [I didn't say, "looking to hook me into your negativity spiral?"]
