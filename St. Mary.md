# St. Mary

## Background

> The Council of Ephesus in 431 sanctioned the cult of the Virgin as Mother of God; the dissemination of images of the Virgin and Child, which came to embody church doctrine, soon followed. (Coisters)

- *theotokos* from earliest period -- "Bearer of God, God bearer"
- Lectures on Terror of history. How the 13th c. was devoted to Mary. Chivalry. Always the men were in charge. Bernard of Clairvaux -- always the **soul** was feminine to Jesus's masculinity.
- [Hildegaard of Bingen](Hildegaard of Bingen.md) one of first in the west to draw out the feminine -- associated with Mary

## History

## What make of it?

It seemed strange to me how I heard over and over again in church about the **love** of God, but another kind of love from that which I most knew: viz. parental or sexual. It was all **men** when it came to picturing the divine. 

Of interest for me = what people aren't talking about. What taken for granted so you don't have to call attention to it. cp. the rules in Catholic church promulgated into the middle ages were only necessary if the rules weren't being followed. The church has by and large tilted in favor of the masculine, to the detriment of the feminine.

In our own time cracks in this façade are beginning to appear. 

- [Androgyne](Androgyne.md) vs. misogyne …  **balance**. I was interested in this from early years, probably under the influence of Carl Jung. The notion that all of us are made up of a mixture of male and female. "Male and female He made them." Most of us with a dominant and a shadow. Health is getting in touch with the shadow.

Mary helps me to remember, to keep in mind for my own life the virtues that are especially to be identified with Mary, with mothers -- not forgetting that I am a father, with all the burden and projection that that brings.

Throughout my ministry I have prayed the Hail Mary especially at times when I didn't know what to do or what to say. There have been countless times when that was the case. Like the prayer of physicians (Hippocratic oath) I pray before I preach, "Lord I pray that I may do no harm." So when I am most in need of a healing touch, I seek the touch of my mother the nurse even more than my father the physician.

All this is figurative, of course. As with much else in the church, we are invited into a rich tapestry of stories and metaphors, parables and paradoxes. Mary is with us in such times.
