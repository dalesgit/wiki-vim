# St. Mary

## Background

> The Council of Ephesus in 431 sanctioned the cult of the Virgin as Mother of God; the dissemination of images of the Virgin and Child, which came to embody church doctrine, soon followed. (Coisters)

- *theotokos* from earliest period -- "Bearer of God, God bearer"
- Lectures on Terror of history. How the 13th c. was devoted to Mary. Chivalry. Always the men were in charge. Bernard of Clairvaux -- always the **soul** was feminine to Jesus's masculinity.
- [Hildegaard of Bingen](Hildegaard of Bingen.md) one of first in the west to draw out the feminine -- associated with Mary
- Then in the Reformation devotion to Mary became a polarizing practice, dividing Catholics from Protestants.

It need not have been so. But in my view it perpetuated a situation in the church where the divine and the sacred were associated with the male and it was the subordinate and the followers who were associated with the female.

## History

- Prayers to girls
- 2 St. Mary's furthest apart
- Chapel at seminary
- Notre Dame Univ.
- changing both Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary for sake of little girls
- ordination on Dec. 8 *Immaculate Conception* -- finding *Nativity of Mary* in the Scottish prayer book. 
- [Angelus](Angelus.md) : Large bell outside the chapel at seminary.
- In the Catholic church the centuries old practice of "doing Hail Mary's" fell off sharply after Vatican II. While a number of Catholic pastors and leaders bemoaned that fact, it was a woman Methodist who wrote a book praising the prayer of Mary. 

## What make of it?

I am, perhaps, not a typical Episcopalian. That hasn't always worked out to be the smoothest path for me in the church.

It seemed strange to me how I heard over and over again in church about the **love** of God, but another kind of love from that which I most knew: viz. parental or sexual. It was all **men** when it came to picturing the divine. 

It has been of interest to me to pay attention to what people **don't** talk about. What taken for granted so you don't have to call attention to it. Consider the rules in Catholic church that were promulgated into the middle ages that they were only necessary because the rules were not being followed. The Church needed to make it the rule that priests don't marry precisely because too many priests were getting married. The church has by and large tilted in favor of the masculine, to the detriment of the feminine, to rule-making instead of nurturing, to uniformity at the expense of the acceptance of diversity.

In our own time cracks in this façade are beginning to appear. 

## [Androgyne](Androgyne.md) vs. Misogyny

… need for **balance**, in the church and in life … and in the **sacred**.

I was interested in this from early years, probably under the influence of Carl Jung. The notion that all of us are made up of a mixture of male and female. "Male and female He made them." Most of us with a dominant and a shadow. Health is getting in touch with the shadow.

Mary helps me to remember, to keep in mind for my own life the virtues that are especially to be identified with Mary, with mothers -- not forgetting that I am a father, with all the burden and projection that that brings.

- nurture
- patience
- encouragement
- "Here I am"

Throughout my ministry I have prayed the Hail Mary especially at times when I didn't know what to do or what to say. There have been countless times when that was the case. Like the prayer of physicians (Hippocratic oath) I pray before I preach, "Lord I pray that I may do no harm." So when I am most in need of a healing touch, in my mind and heart, I seek the touch of my mother the nurse even more than my father the physician.

All this is figurative, of course. As with much else in the church, we are invited into a rich tapestry of stories and metaphors, parables and paradoxes. Mary is comfortable with paradoxes. Mary is with us in such times. In the presence of the **Communion of the Saints**, Mary has a place of prominence.
