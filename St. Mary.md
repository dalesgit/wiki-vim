# St. Mary

- *theotokos* from earliest period
- Lectures on Terror of history. How the 13th c. was devoted to Mary. Chivalry. Always the men were in charge. Bernard of Clairvaux -- always the **soul** was feminine to Jesus's masculinity.
- [Hildegaard of Bingen](Hildegaard of Bingen.md) one of first in the west to draw out the feminine -- associated with Mary
- 
For a summary of the history of the cult.  @8BWNNYVW#Cloisters_ 
- Prayers to girls
- 2 St. Mary's furthest apart
- Chapel at seminary
- Notre Dame Univ.
- changing both Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary for sake of little girls
- ordination on Dec. 8 *Immaculate Conception* -- finding *Nativity of Mary* in the Scottish prayer book. 

It seemed strange to me how I heard over and over again in church about **love** of God, but another kind of love from that which I most knew: viz. parental or sexual. It was all **men** when it came to picturing the divine.

- [Androgyne](Androgyne.md) **balance**.
