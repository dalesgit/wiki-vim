For Sarah,

Last week I was so impressed with the task you had set before you to try to understand "knowledge" from the perspective of western philosophy and the contrasting/complimentary eastern philosophy. Sort of as an immediate intuition, I responded that you ought to consider the place of indigenous philosophy. That caught you by surprise, and altogether your response convinced me that I needed to make some considered response to keep you thinking these new thoughts.

I found myself caught up in an enormous research project – more than I am equipped to deal with. But I thought that I would make an initial response to you; to let you know that I was listening to you and that I had done something to respond to the listening. 

My thoughts in area of indigenous knowledge, spirituality, "religion" are quite fresh. I have only given serious thought to it since my move to Hawai'i in 2001. It turns out that serious research about these broad areas are fairly recent. Where the history of **epistemology** goes back centuries, a serious consideration of indigenous "epistemology" is measured only in decades. 

Perhaps the most important insight that I have had in recent years, is that the very writing and consideration of indigenous thought is colored by the fact that it is the colonizers, the perpetrators of genocide, who have done the writing, done the history, done the evaluating. 

You will find below some very early reporting of my research. I hope that you can get a flavor of why I am intrigued by this pursuit.

## re. Thin Places

When I was processing my upcoming move from Hawai'i to the mainland, I talked a number of times with my Spiritual Director about what to expect and how to continue my spiritual direction. He told me that I should look where there is a concentration of Native Americans. He said that in his experience, indigenous people have an ability to know where there are **thin places**, places where the distance between the sacred and the profane is especially porous, "thin".

## a recent *Substack* post 

Over the next few months on the Liturgical Rebels podcast I will interview a variety of people from different cultures, ethnicities and orientations who hold diverse ideas of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. Today’s interview is with Rev. Dr Randy Woodley a Cherokee descendent, who calls himself a follower of Jesus but not a Christian. His indigenous Native American perspective is an inspiration and a breath of fresh air in the midst of what seem to be increasingly distorted views of what it means to be a Christian.

In this episode of the Liturgical Rebels podcast, Randy Woodley shares his diverse life journey, rooted in his Native American heritage and shaped by his experiences in Western Christianity. He discusses the challenges and insights gained from his faith journey, emphasizing the importance of Indigenous values and the concept of Eloheh, which represents living in harmony. Woodley also reflects on his book, 'Shalom and the Community of Creation,' exploring the values that promote a harmonious existence within communities and the natural world.

In this conversation, I delve into the profound themes of harmony, Shalom, and Indigenous values with Randy Woodley . We explore the interconnectedness of creation and the importance of living in harmony with the environment and each other. Randy also shares ecological and spiritual insights from his children's book 'The Harmony Tree' which is a favourite of both of ours. The discussion also touches on his collaborative work with his wife Edith at the [Eloheh Indigenous Center for Earth Justice](https://substack.com/redirect/f5f1d3b9-59ff-4370-a266-7e0244592416?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg), emphasizing the need for regenerative practices and the teaching of Indigenous spirituality. We conclude with a reflection on indigenous values that can lead to a more stable and happy society.

## from R. Rohr's blog "Creating the Future by Honoring the Past"

*Cherokee descendent Rev. Dr. Randy Woodley and his wife Edith Woodley of the Eastern Shoshone tribe highlight how honoring the wisdom and traditions of our ancestors can inspire us to become healers and changemakers, creating a path to a better future:* 

When we pass our traditions down to the next generation, we are passing down the presence of all our ancestors who came before us. Those songs and stories and teachings are not just from us but from those who came before us. Our ceremonies connect us to our ancestors because we know they once stood where we now stand, using the same traditions.  

I (Edith) bead Indian jewelry. My mother also did great Indian beadwork. Often when I am beading, I find my thoughts drifting to my mother, especially when I look at my hands. I think about what she would do with a color or a stitch, or how she looked for patterns or asked my dad what he thought. Then I ask Randy the same questions. In some ways, my mother is there with me during that practice. Randy’s mom loved nature, especially birds and flowers. When he sees exceptionally beautiful birds or flowers, his mother always comes to mind. “My mom would love this one,” he often says to me when he sees a hummingbird or a robin or a pretty flower. Our ancestors are always present to lead us into the future.  

When sharing stories, Native American elders often drift freely between current and past events. They may begin a story by saying something like “A long time ago …,” but if you listen carefully, you’ll notice that the behavior or problem they are addressing is likely a current one. Indigenous learning comes through reflected experience. We learn about how to live now by examining what has happened in our history.  

We depend on our stories, our ceremonies, and other traditions to guide us to a good future. Often that future is best expressed through exploring things from the past. We mine our past for those gems that are our payment for the future. That is why our stories and other past concerns are so very important. Without our past, we cannot be a people in the future.  

Think about what you have carried forward from your parents, grandparents, or caregivers. What practices, ideas, or lifeways rooted in the past are you keeping alive? 

## from *Earth Prayer*

> *I have read from this book for several years as a part of my evening prayers. It is filled with sources that might well be characterized as **indigenous**. Below is an example.*

Grandfather Great Spirit\
All over the world the faces of living ones\
are alike.\
With tenderness they have come up out\
of the ground\
Look upon your children that they may face the winds and walk the good road to\
the Day of Quiet.\
Grandfather Great Spirit\
Fill us with the Light.\
Give us the strength to understand, and the eyes to see.\
Teach us to walk the soft Earth as relatives\
to all that live.

## *The Knowledge Seeker: Embracing Indigenous Spirituality* (Stonechild and Starblanket, 2016)

> Blair Stonechild shares his sixty-year journey of learning-from residential school to PhD and beyond-while trying to find a place for Indigenous spirituality in the classroom. Encouraged by an Elder who insisted sacred information be written down, Stonechild explores the underlying philosophy of his people's teachings to demonstrate that Indigenous spirituality can speak to our urgent, contemporary concerns.

## *Living and writing indigenous spiritual resistance* (Iseke-Barnes, 2003)

> Abstract of paper:
> For Indigenous peoples working inside institutions it is important to work in ways that support decolonizing the mind and spirit. It is important to find ways of creating, interrogating, validating, and disseminating knowledges. Telling stories is a practice in Indigenous cultures which has sustained communities and which validates the experiences of Indigenous peoples and epistemologies. This paper explores the importance of inclusion of Indigenous knowledges in academic settings through three stories about: (1) academic insistence that knowledge is outside the self, (2) backlash to Indigenous practices in academe, and (3) intergenerational impacts of experiences of suppression in education. The stories help us critique theoretical conceptions of what constitutes “valid” knowledge and understand struggles for survival and resistance to domination in educational institutions. The paper explores responses to dominant societies' suppression of Indigenous knowledges in academic settings and broader society through acts of resistance, storytelling, living spiritual resistance, writing as survival strategies, and resistance within education. This paper explores ways that Indigenous knowledges are honored, affirmed, and shared.

## Rediscovering the potential of Indigenous Storytelling

Several intergovernmental policy instruments, including the World Heritage Convention of UNESCO and the Convention on Biological Diversity, have proposed to develop integrated strategies to build bridges between biological and cultural diversity agendas. We contend that to succeed in this endeavor, it is crucial to link biocultural revitalization to conservation practice. Our hope with this review is to call attention to indigenous storytelling as an option worth adding to the repertoire of conservation practitioners who aim to: (1) link conservation actions to indigenous worldviews; (2) foster connections between indigenous peoples and their landscapes; (3) facilitate intergenerational transfer of indigenous knowledge; (4) support dialogue over conservation; and (5) promote local participation in conservation. Because indigenous stories are full of resonance, memory, and wisdom—in a footing that is structurally free of power imbalance between conservation practitioners and local communities—, we contend that they can be crucial to guide future efforts in biocultural conservation practice. Our review shows that deeper consideration and promotion of indigenous storytelling can lead to enhanced understanding of diverse values and perceptions around biodiversity, while offering a constructive approach for greater inclusion of indigenous peoples in conservation pursuits.
