# Mary Jean commital
## Notes re. Deb
- Brother Steve. Other grandparents who have CA. If June hadn't died she wouldn't have had the opportunity to get to know Mary Jean.
- She is imagining brief graveside service followed by sharing at restaurant.
- I will do a draft and send her the materials to work with.
- She counts ca. 25.
