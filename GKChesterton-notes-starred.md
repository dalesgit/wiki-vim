## Christian ideal
**“The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried.”**  

― G.K. Chesterton, [What's Wrong with the World](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/646052)

## Children
“Fairy tales do not tell children the dragons exist. Children already know that dragons exist. Fairy tales tell children the dragons can be killed.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“For children are innocent and love justice, while most of us are wicked and naturally prefer mercy.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [Tremendous Trifles](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/256529)

## Love
“There is the great lesson of 'Beauty and the Beast,' that a thing must be loved before it is lovable.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“The Bible tells us to love our neighbors, and also to love our enemies; probably because generally they are the same people.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“Love means to love that which is unlovable; or it is no virtue at all.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“I wish we could sometimes love the characters in real life as we love the characters in romances. There are a great many human souls whom we should accept more kindly, and even appreciate more clearly, if we simply thought of them as people in a story.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [What I Saw in America](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1528944)



## Gratitude

“I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought; and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“Hope is the power of being cheerful in circumstances that we know to be desperate.”**
― G.K. Chesterton


## good
**“The word "good" has many meanings. For example, if a man were to shoot his grandmother at a range of five hundred yards, I should call him a good shot, but not necessarily a good man.”**
― G.K. Chesterton


## action

“To have a right to do a thing is not at all the same as to be right in doing it.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“I believe in getting into hot water; it keeps you clean.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to submit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be walking about.”  
― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)

**“If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“We do not need to get good laws to restrain bad people. We need to get good people to restrain us from bad laws.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“Men do not differ much about what things they will call evils; they differ enormously about what evils they will call excusable.”**
― G. K. Chesterton

**“The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types -- the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“My country, right or wrong,” is a thing that no patriot would think of saying except in a desperate case. It is like saying, “My mother, drunk or sober.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [The Defendant](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/977633)

**“In prosperity, our friends know us. In adversity, we know our friends”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly; the rich have always objected to being governed at all.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“Let your religion be less of a theory and more of a love affair.”  
― G. K. Chesterton

## knowledge
**“Fallacies do not cease to be fallacies because they become fashions.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“It isn't that they can't see the solution. It is that they can't see the problem.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“The world will never starve for want of wonders; but only for want of wonder.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [Tremendous Trifles](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/256529)

**“Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)

**“Impartiality is a pompous name for indifference which is an elegant name for ignorance.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

## humility
**“Angels can fly because they can take themselves lightly.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)

“Dear Sir: Regarding your article 'What's Wrong with the World?' I am. Yours truly,”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“Humility is the mother of giants. One sees great things from the valley; only small things from the peak.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [The Innocence of Father Brown](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/3300188)
## Wonder

**“If seeds in the black earth can turn into such beautiful roses, what might not the heart of man become in its long journey toward the stars?”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“We should always endeavor to wonder at the permanent thing, not at the mere exception. We should be startled by the sun, and not by the eclipse. We should wonder less at the earthquake, and wonder more at the earth.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“The most extraordinary thing in the world is an ordinary man and an ordinary woman and their ordinary children.”**
― G.K. Chesterton


## other
**“There's a lot of difference between listening and hearing.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree. That is not a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get round in front--”  
― G.K. Chesterton, [The Man Who Was Thursday](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/195447)

**“The object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“According to most philosophers, God in making the world enslaved it. According to Christianity, in making it, He set it free. God had written, not so much a poem, but rather a play; a play he had planned as perfect, but which had necessarily been left to human actors and stage-managers, who had since made a great mess of it.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)
