# John the Baptist homily

- Fr. Carroll and I at week day mass. Became a part of my rhythm of life. He led me to adult decision. He was my first spiritual director -- though I didn't call him that. He ended up taking theological positions that I was opposed to.
- How to find the "Good News" in this? -- It's OK to ask questions. The more pointed the better.
- **John the baptizer**  was clearly one of the established part of the *kerygma*. Piece of the evidence is that his baptizing Jesus was one of the things that the early church (in the NT) wrestled with. Which was superior?

In future years I found the sustaining Good News in the prayer John's father offered at his birth. For me, John the Baptist became a **stand in** for **every person**. For all of us. Each of us leads the way to the Lord.

1:63-64 Asking for a tablet, Zachariah wrote, “His name is to be John.” That took everyone by surprise. Surprise followed surprise—Zachariah’s mouth was now open, his tongue loose, and he was talking, praising God!

65-66 A deep, reverential fear settled over the neighborhood, and in all that Judean hill country people talked about nothing else. Everyone who heard about it took it to heart, wondering, “What will become of this child? Clearly, God has his hand in this.”

67-79 Then Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied,

Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;
    he came and set his people free.
He set the power of salvation in the center of our lives,
    and in the very house of David his servant,
Just as he promised long ago
    through the preaching of his holy prophets:
Deliverance from our enemies
    and every hateful hand;
Mercy to our fathers,
    as he remembers to do what he said he’d do,
What he swore to our father Abraham—
    a clean rescue from the enemy camp,
So we can worship him without a care in the world,
    made holy before him as long as we live.

And **you, my child, “Prophet of the Highest,”
    will go ahead of the Master to prepare his ways,
Present the offer of salvation to his people,
    the forgiveness of their sins.**
Through the heartfelt mercies of our God,
    God’s Sunrise will break in upon us,
Shining on those in the darkness,
    those sitting in the shadow of death,
Then showing us the way, one foot at a time,
    down the path of peace.

80 The child grew up, healthy and spirited. He lived out in the desert until the day he made his prophetic debut in Israel.

Each of us will fall short of our potential to prepare the world for Jesus. Each of us in this room has heard the call.

As each of us, as John did, grew up. We were healthy and spirited. And until the present day, we have done what we could to prepare the world for Jesus. Unlike John, for each of us, we're not done yet.
