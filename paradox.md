# paradox

- cf. Parker Palmer 
    
    @7QZJ9G68#Palmer_2010: "examines some of the challenging questions at the core of Christian spirituality. How do we live with the apparent opposition between good and evil, scarcity and abundance, individuality and community, death and new life? We can hold them as paradoxes, not "either/ors," allowing them to open our minds and hearts to new ways of seeing and being"
