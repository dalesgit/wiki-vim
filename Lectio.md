Ephesians 1:7

Wisdom and perception of revelation to allow for deepening of knowledge (as relationship) with "him" -- namely "father of glory"

Hope … "put your hope in the Lord". Like a bucket that you put water in. What is the source of the Hope? Psalm 130:7

Lord, teach us the distinction between the brokenness that leads us to squander our gifts and the brokenness that leads us to seek and find you, even in the most desolate places. Amen. (Common Prayer)

Today was from Psalm 23: … thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. I reflected that the notion so pervades all religious responses that we expect God to do be doing something. I asked today, "What if God isn't doing anything. What if it's all about us." Keating wrote that without the trials and tribulations we would remain as we were -- unchanged. 

I gave thanks for the times when I am able to get insight and to hear with new ears.

- We had trouble with today's reading. [MP.md](MP.md) so troubled by the school shooting. And Tucker Carlson providing megaphone for Nazi guest. "How can God allow …" But the reading had to do with, "Do we want to meet God as s/he really is." Then the reading from Numbers: take journey out of the wilderness. For myself I thought that I can meet the God who journeys with us. But I also saw (from the conversation) that our acceptance of the horror of school shootings, our numbness to our national role in taking down the planet environmentally, is no different from the German's slow walk into accepting / numbness to the Holocaust solution. MP not too prone to listen to my take on it.

- from yesterday or day before. "The kingdom of God is within you." That rendering seemed helpful when I was young. Today it sounds hollow, individualistic, "Protestant", and too narrow. God being everywhere, the creator of the Cosmos, God's "kingdom" -- our crude overly-humanized words for ? -- is breathtakingly not limited in any way to **me**. 
- Mt 13:33. **Leaven** as a symbol of corruption? (T. Keating) cp. [What does leaven symbolize in the Bible? | GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/leaven-in-the-Bible.html "What does leaven symbolize in the Bible? | GotQuestions.org") for the varied ways "leaven" is used in Bible. It's not clear-cut or unambiguous.
- Lectio from Centering Prayer: Mt 6:6-8. For me I felt affirmed about "going into my secret room" in my efforts last night while doing dishes. I shared the Annie Dillard story about liturgy with Elaine :names: whom we took back to Coral Oaks.
