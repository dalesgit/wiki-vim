# Lectio
## Thu 05 Sep 2024 
- from yesterday or day before. "The kingdom of God is within you." That rendering seemed helpful when I was young. Today it sounds hollow, individualistic, "Protestant", and too narrow. God being everywhere, the creator of the Cosmos, God's "kingdom" -- our crude overly-humanized words for ? -- is breathtakingly not limited in any way to **me**. 
- Mt 13:33. **Leaven** as a symbol of corruption? (T. Keating) cp. [What does leaven symbolize in the Bible? | GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/leaven-in-the-Bible.html "What does leaven symbolize in the Bible? | GotQuestions.org") for the varied ways "leaven" is used in Bible. It's not clear-cut or unambiguous.
- Lectio from Centering Prayer: Mt 6:6-8. For me I felt affirmed about "going into my secret room" in my efforts last night while doing dishes. I shared the Annie Dillard story about liturgy with Elaine :names: whom we took back to Coral Oaks.
