1 Co 13: 5,10,13-14. "knowing in part" is an antidote to the individualism of: my truth vs. your truth, my God vs. your God, individualized religion, individualism. Related to my insight about how everyone thinks they're right. What if we all could shift to recognizing that we only "know in part".

Ps. 131:2 … weaned child with mother. This felt strikingly new to me.  Led me in the direction of reflecting on the noise in our contemporary lives, noise from technology and noise within us. Image of a toddler at mother's shoulder, being comforted and sheltered.

<sup>1</sup> LORD, my heart isn't proud; my eyes aren't conceited. I don't get involved with things too great or wonderful for me.\
<sup>2</sup> No. But I have calmed and quieted myself like a weaned child on its mother; I'm like the weaned child that is with me.\
<sup>3</sup> Israel, wait for the LORD— from now until forever from now!

"God laid down God's life for us in the Cross"

John 14:6-7. "See God." For me, focusing on this part of the passage pushes against the exclusivity that people lean on from the first part: "I am the way …" People (me) __see__ God manifest in all kinds of ways and circumstances. __Christian__ is not at all the exclusive way.

### psalm 137
Hokuleia
Lydia listening to the dolphins
Jerry a song with 3 movements: moving from morning to mixture
Balm of gilead
Open the eyes of my heart Lord.

  **The Promised Shore**
  
  Plunge into the Ocean of Love where heart meets Heart.
  Where sorrows are comforted, and wounds are mended.
  There melodies of sadness mingle with dolphin songs of joy;
  Past fears dissolve in deep harmonic tones,
  The future -- pure mystery
  For eternal moments lived in total surrender, glide smoothly
  Over troubled waters.
  Hide not from Love, O friend sink not into the sea of despair,
  The mire of hatred.
  Awaken, O my heart, that I drown not in fear.
  Too long have I sailed where ever the winds have blown!
  Drop anchor! O heart of all hearts, set a clear course,
  That I might follow! Guide me to the Promised Shore!

  Gal. 4:6 … Abba. Need to just change the word (e.g. Lord's prayer)
## Thu 12 Sep 2024 
  Ephesians 1:7
  
  Wisdom and perception of revelation to allow for deepening of knowledge (as relationship) with "him" -- namely "father of glory"

  Hope … "put your hope in the Lord". Like a bucket that you put water in. What is the source of the Hope? Psalm 130:7
  
  Lord, teach us the distinction between the brokenness that leads us to squander our gifts and the brokenness that leads us to seek and find you, even in the most desolate places. Amen. (Common Prayer)

  Today was from Psalm 23: … thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. I reflected that the notion so pervades all religious responses that we expect God to do be doing something. I asked today, "What if God isn't doing anything. What if it's all about us." Keating wrote that without the trials and tribulations we would remain as we were -- unchanged. 
  
  I gave thanks for the times when I am able to get insight and to hear with new ears.

We had trouble with today's reading. [MP.md](MP.md) so troubled by the school shooting. And Tucker Carlson providing megaphone for Nazi guest. "How can God allow …" But the reading had to do with, "Do we want to meet God as s/he really is." Then the reading from Numbers: take journey out of the wilderness. For myself I thought that I can meet the God who journeys with us. But I also saw (from the conversation) that our acceptance of the horror of school shootings, our numbness to our national role in taking down the planet environmentally, is no different from the German's slow walk into accepting / numbness to the Holocaust solution. MP not too prone to listen to my take on it.

from yesterday or day before. "The kingdom of God is within you." That rendering seemed helpful when I was young. Today it sounds hollow, individualistic, "Protestant", and too narrow. God being everywhere, the creator of the Cosmos, God's "kingdom" -- our crude overly-humanized words for ? -- is breathtakingly not limited in any way to **me**.
Mt 13:33. **Leaven** as a symbol of corruption? (T. Keating) cp. [What does leaven symbolize in the Bible? | GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/leaven-in-the-Bible.html "What does leaven symbolize in the Bible? | GotQuestions.org") for the varied ways "leaven" is used in Bible. It's not clear-cut or unambiguous.
Lectio from Centering Prayer: Mt 6:6-8. For me I felt affirmed about "going into my secret room" in my efforts last night while doing dishes. I shared the Annie Dillard story about liturgy with Elaine :names: whom we took back to Coral Oaks.
