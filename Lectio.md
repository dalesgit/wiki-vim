# Lectio

- We had trouble with today's reading. [MP.md](MP.md) so troubled by the school shooting. And Tucker Carlson providing megaphone for Nazi guest. "How can God allow â€¦" But the reading had to do with, "Do we want to meet God as s/he really is." Then the reading from Numbers: take journey out of the wilderness. For myself I thought that I can meet the God who journeys with us. But I also saw (from the conversation) that our acceptance of the horror of school shootings, our numbness to our national role in taking down the planet environmentally, is no different from the German's slow walk into accepting / numbness to the Holocaust solution. MP not too prone to listen to my take on it.

- from yesterday or day before. "The kingdom of God is within you." That rendering seemed helpful when I was young. Today it sounds hollow, individualistic, "Protestant", and too narrow. God being everywhere, the creator of the Cosmos, God's "kingdom" -- our crude overly-humanized words for ? -- is breathtakingly not limited in any way to **me**. 
- Mt 13:33. **Leaven** as a symbol of corruption? (T. Keating) cp. [What does leaven symbolize in the Bible? | GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/leaven-in-the-Bible.html "What does leaven symbolize in the Bible? | GotQuestions.org") for the varied ways "leaven" is used in Bible. It's not clear-cut or unambiguous.
- Lectio from Centering Prayer: Mt 6:6-8. For me I felt affirmed about "going into my secret room" in my efforts last night while doing dishes. I shared the Annie Dillard story about liturgy with Elaine :names: whom we took back to Coral Oaks.
