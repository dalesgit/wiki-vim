SUNDAY EVENING PRAYER I
Palm 141
Let my prayer rise like incense, my upraised hands, like an evening sacrifice.

Hurry, Lord! I call and call!

Listen! I plead with you.

Let my prayer rise like incense, my upraised hands, like an evening sacrifice.

Lord, guard my lips, watch my every word.

Let me never speak evil or consider hateful deeds, let me never join the wicked to eat their lavish meals.

If the just correct me, I take their rebuke as kindness, but the unction of the wicked will never touch my head.

I pray and pray against their hateful ways.

Let them be thrown against a rock of judgment, then they will know I spoke the truth.

Then they will say,

"Our bones lie broken upon the ground, scattered at the grave's edge."

Lord my God, I turn to you, in you I find safety.

Do not strip me of life.

Do not spring on me the traps of the wicked.

Let evildoers get tangled in their own nets, but let me escape.

口

Palm 142

You are my refuge, God,

all I have in the land of the living.

I pray, I plead, I cry for mercy, Lord;

I pour out all my troubles, the story of my distress.

My spirit fails me.

You know the road I walk and the traps hidden from me.

See what they are doing!

No one befriends me or cares for me.

There is no escape, so I turn to you, Lord.

I know you are my refuge, all I have in the land of the living.

I am pleading, hear me!

I have no strength.

God, rescue me!

They hunt me down, and overwhelm me.

Free me from this cage!

Then I will praise your name and gather with the just

to thank you for your kindness. D

Sunday morning prayer

Psalm 63

SUNDAY MORNING PRAYER

As morning breaks I look to you, O God, to be my strength this day, hallelujah.

God, my God, you I crave; my soul thirsts for you, my body aches for you like a dry and weary land.

Let me gaze on you in your temple: a vision of strength and glory.

Your love is better than life, my speech is full of praise.

I give you a lifetime of worship, my hands raised in your name.

I feast at a rich table, my lips sing of your glory.

On my bed I lie awake, your memory fills the night.

You have been my help, I rejoice beneath your wings.

Yes, I cling to you, your right hand holds me fast.

Let those who want me dead end up deep in the grave!

They will die by the sword, their bodies food for jackals.

But let the king find joy in God.

All who swear the truth be praised, every lying mouth be shut. o

Psalm 149

Sing a new song, you faithful, praise God in the assembly, hallelujah.

Sing a new song, you faithful, praise God in the assembly.

Israel, rejoice in your maker, Zion, in your king.

Dance in the Lord's name, sounding harp and tambourine.

The Lord delights

in saving a helpless people.

Revel in God's glory, join in clan by clan.

Shout praise from your throat, sword flashing in hand to discipline nations and punish the wicked, to shackle their kings and chain their leaders, and execute God's sentence.

You faithful, this is your glory!

Hallelujah!o

Sunday evening prayer 2

Palm 110

I will raise your scepter over Zion and beyond, hallelujah.

The Lord decrees to the king:

"Take the throne at my right hand, I will make your enemies a footrest.

I will raise your scepter over Zion and beyond, over all your enemies.

"Your people stand behind you on the day you take command.

You are made holy, splendid, newborn like the dawn, fresh like the dew."

God's oath is firm:

"You are a priest for ever, the rightful king by my decree." The Lord stands at your side to destroy kings on the day of wrath.

God executes judgment, crushes the heads of nations, and brings carnage worldwide.

The victor drinks from a wayside stream and rises refreshed. •

Psalm 114

Tremble! earth, before the Lord, before the God of Jacob.

Israel marches out of Egypt, Jacob leaves an alien people.

Judah becomes a holy place, Israel, God's domain.

The sea pulls back for them, the Jordan flees in retreat.

Mountains jump like rams, hills like lambs in fear.

Why shrink back, O sea?

Jordan, why recoil?

Why shudder, mountains, like rams?

Why quiver, hills, like lambs?

Tremble! earth, before the Lord, before the God of Jacob, who turns rock to water, flint to gushing streams. •

Alleluia!

Praise our God, you faithful servants!

Alleluia, Alleluia!

In awe praise God, you small and great!

Alleluia, Alleluia!

Alleluia!

The Lord God almighty rules!

Alleluia, Alleluia!

Be glad, rejoice, give glory to God!

Alleluia, Alleluia!

Alleluia!

The wedding feast of the Lamb begins.

Alleluia, Alleluia!

The bride is radiant, clothed in glory.

Alleluia, Alleluia! (or: Amen. Alleluia!) •

Monday Morning Prayer

Psalm 5
MONDAY MORNING PRAYER

I pray to you, Lord, my prayer rises with the sun.

Hear my words, my groans, my cries for help,

• God my king.

I pray to you, Lord, my prayer rises with the sun.

At dawn I plead my case and wait.

You never welcome evil, God, never let it stay.

You hate arrogance and abhor scoundrels, you detest violence and destroy the traitor.

But by your great mercy

I enter your house and bend low in awe within your holy temple.

In the face of my enemies clear the way, bring me your justice.

Their charges are groundless, they breathe destruction; their tongues are smooth, their throat an open grave.

God, pronounce them guilty, catch them in their own plots, expel them for their sins; they have betrayed you.

But let those who trust you be glad and celebrate for ever.

Protect those who love your name, then they will delight in you.

For you bless the just, O God, your grace surrounds them like a shield. •

Psalm 29

Give glory to God, honor God's name.

Give the Lord glory, you spirits!

Give glory! Honor God's strength!

Honor the name of the Lord!

Bow when the Lord comes, majestic and holy.

God's voice thunders above the massive seas; powerful, splendid,

God shatters the cedars, shatters the cedars of Lebanon, makes Lebanon jump like a calf, Sirion like a wild ox.

God's voice strikes fire, makes the desert shudder, Qadesh shudder in labor, deer writhe in labor.

God strips the trees.

All shout "Glory" in your temple, Lord.

For you rule the mighty waters, you rule over all for ever.

Give strength to your people, Lord, and bless your people with peace. •

Tuesday morning prayer

Psalm 24

TUESDAY MORNING PRAYER

Whoever has integrity

shall climb the mountain of God.

God owns this planet and all its riches.

The earth and every creature belong to God.

God set the land on top of the seas and anchored it in the deep.

Who is fit to climb God's mountain and stand in his holy place?

Whoever has integrity: not chasing shadows, not living lies.

God will bless them, their savior will bring justice.

These people long to see the Lord, they seek the face of Jacob's God.

Stretch toward heaven, you gates, open high and wide.

Let the glorious sovereign enter.

Who is this splendid ruler?

The Lord of power and might, the conqueror of chaos.

Stretch toward heaven, you gates, open high and wide.

Let the glorious sovereign enter.

Who is this splendid ruler?

The Lord of heaven's might, this splendid ruler is God. •

Psalm 33

Lovers of justice, shout joy to the Lord.

Shout joy to the Lord, lovers of justice, how right to praise!

Praise God on the harp, with ten-string lyre sing to the Lord.

Sing God a new song.

Play music to match your shout of joy.

For the word of the Lord is true: what God says, God does.

This lover of truth and justice fills the earth with love.

God speaks: the heavens are made;

God breathes: the stars shine.

God bottles the waters of the sea and stores them in the deep.

All earth, be astounded, stand in awe of God.

God speaks: the world is;

God commands: all things appear.

God blocks the plans of nations, disrupts all they contrive.

But God's plan and design lasts from age to age.

Blest the land whose god is the Lord, the heirs whom God has chosen.

The Lord looks down and sees our human kind.

From heaven God surveys all peoples on earth.

The maker of human hearts knows every human act.

Armies do not save kings, brute force does not spare soldiers.

The warhorse is a sham;

despite its power, it will not save.

God keeps a loving eye on all who believe,

on those who count on God to bring relief from famine, to rescue them from death.

With all we are, we wait for God, the Lord, our help, our shield.

Our hearts find joy in the Lord; we trust God's holy name.

Love us, Lord!

We wait for you.

Tuesday evening prayer

Psalm 20

God has given victory to Christ.

God defend you in battle! set you safe above the fray!

The God of Jacob send you help, and from holy Zion, keep you strong!

May God recall your many gifts and be pleased with your sacrifice, favoring all your hopes, making your plans succeed.

Then we will sing of your conquest, raise the flags in triumph, to proclaim the name of our God who grants all you ask.

Now I know for certain: the anointed of the Lord is given victory.

God favors him from highest heaven with a strong, saving hand.

Some boast of chariots and horses, but we boast of God's name.

They waver and fall, but we stand firm.

Lord, give victory to your king, answer us on the day we call. o

Psalm 21

Rejoice in your victory, Lord; we sing and praise your strength.

Lord, the king triumphs with your help, exults in the victory you gave; you granted what he hoped for, accomplished what he asked.

You handed him this blessing and crowned him with gold; he begged only to be spared, but you multiplied his years.

All his glory is in your victory, for you invest him with royal splendor, confer on him lasting blessings, and give him joy in your presence.

The king relies on the Most High;

God's love becomes his strength.

Your hands search out your enemies, uncover all who hate you; you burn them with your anger, consume them in your fiery blaze.

Your fury swallows them, the fire devours them;

you purge them from the land and leave them no offspring.

For they plotted and schemed against you, but their evil did not succeed; you made them turn and run from the deadly aim of your arrows.

Rejoice in your victory, Lord!

We sing and praise your strength. o
