# Hawaiian values

Let all who have ears, hear, your Church needs you.

At the 2003 diocese convention, Aunty Pua Hopkins spoke about a resolution that was introduced by Mtr. Mahi Biemes; “Incorporating Hawaiian Christian Concepts into the Episcopal Church in Hawai'i.” 

Aunty Pua explained the major Hawaiian spiritual concepts, history and meaning of these Hawaiian words --- of mana, mālama, and pono.

**Mana**, in Christian terms, is the understanding that along with all of God’s creation, we are filled with the spiritual energy and gifts and talents that come from being created by God.

**Mālama**, recognizing and caring for the mana in all of creation, is what we as Christians are called to do in all aspects of our lives. The Catechism in the Book of Common Prayer says, “the universe is the work of a single loving God: (it) belongs to its creator and we are called to enjoy it and care for it in accordance with God’s purposes...all people are worthy of respect and honor because all are created in the image of God.” We are responsible to mālama all of God’s creation because of the sacredness, the mana, that is inseparable from all that God creates.

**Pono**, righteousness, is achieved when we successfully mālama all our relationships within God’s creation so that the mana in them is undisturbed or even strengthened. As Christians, we are constantly striving to be pono, and we are sustained by the gift of God’s amazing grace: the life, death and resurrection of his Son Jesus Christ to reconcile us to God when we stray from the path of righteousness and to enable us to try again.

 

We in this wahi pana, this sacred place, our Cathedral Church of St. Andrews in Hawaii are all heirs to this rich spiritual legacy from our founders, King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. It is a unique gift that should be incorporated into our life as a Christian community, so that our past can inform our present and shape our future, and we can come to the fullness of who we are in the place where we are planted. Na Makana a ke Akua no ka Po’e a ke Akua, the Gifts of God is for the people of God.

 

Please join me and the members of your Chapter this week ﻿Sunday, August 4, 2024, after the 9:00 a.m. in Davies Hall; as we share financial updates, our focused projects and areas of opportunities that members of this congregation can provide or a connection you can make to help our staff or the Cathedral as a whole. We are looking forward to seeing all of you.

For Clergy and People

Almighty and everlasting God, from whom cometh every

good and perfect gift: Send down upon our bishops, and

other clergy, and upon the congregations committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace: and, that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy blessing. Grant this, O Lord, for the honor of our Advocate and Mediator, Jesus Christ. Amen.
