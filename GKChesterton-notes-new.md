“The true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him, but because he loves what is behind him.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

― G.K. Chesterton

― G.K. Chesterton

“Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, "Do it again"; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, "Do it again" to the sun; and every evening, "Do it again" to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we.”  
― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)

**“The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [What's Wrong with the World](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/646052)

“I would maintain that thanks are the highest form of thought; and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“Do not be so open-minded that your brains fall out.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“A good novel tells us the truth about its hero; but a bad novel tells us the truth about its author.”  
― G.K. Chesterton, [Heretics](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1884008)

“An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“To have a right to do a thing is not at all the same as to be right in doing it.”

― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)

― G.K. Chesterton

“Religious liberty might be supposed to mean that everybody is free to discuss religion. In practice it means that hardly anybody is allowed to mention it.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“Fallacies do not cease to be fallacies because they become fashions.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“It is absurd for the Evolutionist to complain that it is unthinkable for an admittedly unthinkable God to make everything out of nothing, and then pretend that it is more thinkable that nothing should turn itself into everything.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“Dear Sir: Regarding your article 'What's Wrong with the World?' I am. Yours truly,”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“People wonder why the novel is the most popular form of literature; people wonder why it is read more than books of science or books of metaphysics. The reason is very simple; it is merely that the novel is more true than they are.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“You can only find truth with logic if you have already found truth without it.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“We do not need to get good laws to restrain bad people. We need to get good people to restrain us from bad laws.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“The main point of Christianity was this: that Nature is not our mother: Nature is our sister.”

“But the new rebel is a skeptic, and will not entirely trust anything. He has no loyalty; therefore he can never be really a revolutionist. And the fact that he doubts everything really gets in his way when he wants to denounce anything. For all denunciation implies a moral doctrine of some kind; and the modern revolutionist doubts not only the institution he denounces, but the doctrine by which he denounces it. . . . As a politician, he will cry out that war is a waste of life, and then, as a philosopher, that all life is waste of time. A Russian pessimist will denounce a policeman for killing a peasant, and then prove by the highest philosophical principles that the peasant ought to have killed himself. . . . The man of this school goes first to a political meeting, where he complains that savages are treated as if they were beasts; then he takes his hat and umbrella and goes on to a scientific meeting, where he proves that they practically are beasts. In short, the modern revolutionist, being an infinite skeptic, is always engaged in undermining his own mines. In his book on politics he attacks men for trampling on morality; in his book on ethics he attacks morality for trampling on men. Therefore the modern man in revolt has become practically useless for all purposes of revolt. By rebelling against everything he has lost his right to rebel against anything.”  
― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)

“Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the world. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal. That is not a tree, but the back of a tree. That is not a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get round in front--”  
― G.K. Chesterton, [The Man Who Was Thursday](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/195447)

**“Men do not differ much about what things they will call evils; they differ enormously about what evils they will call excusable.”**
― G. K. Chesterton

“If you happen to read fairy tales, you will observe that one idea runs from one end of them to the other--the idea that peace and happiness can only exist on some condition. This idea, which is the core of ethics, is the core of the nursery-tales.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types -- the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“If seeds in the black earth can turn into such beautiful roses, what might not the heart of man become in its long journey toward the stars?”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“There are two ways of getting home; and one of them is to stay there.”  
― G.K. Chesterton, [The Everlasting Man](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/2420302)

**“We should always endeavor to wonder at the permanent thing, not at the mere exception. We should be startled by the sun, and not by the eclipse. We should wonder less at the earthquake, and wonder more at the earth.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“My country, right or wrong,” is a thing that no patriot would think of saying except in a desperate case. It is like saying, “My mother, drunk or sober.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [The Defendant](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/977633)

**“The object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

“The difference between the poet and the mathematician is that the poet tries to get his head into the heavens while the mathematician tries to get the heavens into his head.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“Do not free a camel of the burden of his hump; you may be freeing him from being a camel.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“I regard golf as an expensive way of playing marbles.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“In prosperity, our friends know us. In adversity, we know our friends”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“Hope is the power of being cheerful in circumstances that we know to be desperate.”**
― G.K. Chesterton

**“According to most philosophers, God in making the world enslaved it. According to Christianity, in making it, He set it free. God had written, not so much a poem, but rather a play; a play he had planned as perfect, but which had necessarily been left to human actors and stage-managers, who had since made a great mess of it.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)

“The things we see every day are the things we never see at all.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

**“Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.”**
― G.K. Chesterton, [Tremendous Trifles](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/256529)

“Journalism largely consists in saying "Lord Jones is dead" to people who never knew Lord Jones was alive.”  
― G.K. Chesterton

“Fairy tales say that apples were golden only to refresh the forgotten moment when we found that they were green. They make rivers run with wine only to make us remember, for one wild moment, that they run with water.”  
― G.K. Chesterton, [Orthodoxy](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/work/quotes/1807543)
