Marcus & Ginny were the confidants // SD to one another
His motivation was to know "what makes me tick"
Hot button for him: historical/critical reading
Lectio: "he was called to love passionately"
He expected me to tell MP about our conversations
We talked through his job search of 1+ years: 50+ y/o married to 70+ woman
