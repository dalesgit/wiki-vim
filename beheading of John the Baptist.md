# beheading of John the Baptist

All four Gospels give an account of John the Baptist as a prophet and preacher whose ministry created expectation and awakened a wave of repentance leading to baptism among many different groups of people.  Two Sundays in Advent focus on that preaching and the First Sunday after the Epiphany celebrates Jesus’ baptism by John as a central moment where the fullness of Christ’s humanity and divinity are revealed. In Mark’s Gospel, John’s arrest is the moment when Jesus begins his public ministry. John’s death likewise has a profound impact on the narrative in the Gospels.

Herod, who regarded John with the apprehension of a tyrant for a leader among the people and with the superstitious dread of the wicked for true spiritual power, let himself be cornered into condemning John to death. The Gospel recounts the sordid tale of a young woman’s manipulation and the foolish promise that Herod makes. Caught by his own rash promise and pride, Herod has the man he fears put to death and his head delivered on a platter to the girl, who takes it to her mother, Herodias. The gruesome narrative ends, as John’s disciples take his body and bury it and then go to Jesus to tell him what has happened.  After the death of John the Baptist, Jesus, with his disciples, withdraws from the crowds, but they follow. No doubt the unjust execution of a fierce and admired prophet left many in fear, anger, and confusion. That day’s teaching led to the Feeding of the Five Thousand and soon thereafter to the Transfiguration, Peter’s Confession, and the First Prediction of the Passion. As John’s ministry had been integral to the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, John’s death was part of the turning point as the narratives turn toward Jerusalem and the cross.  John’s role as the one who points toward Jesus and who baptized him, the family connections that Luke’s birth narrative relates, and the role that John plays in the spiritual life of the people give weight to his death which, like his preaching, foreshadowed Jesus’ ministry and his death.

This feast, along with the Feast of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, found its place in the church’s calendar very early.

Almighty God, who called your servant John the Baptist to go before your Son our Lord both in life and death; Grant that we who remember his witness may with boldness speak your truth and in humility hear it when it is spoken to us, through Jesus Christ, the firstborn from the dead, who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns one God for ever and ever. Amen.

Preface of a Saint (2)

### 2 Corinthians 4:5-11

We do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake. For it is the God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that it may be made clear that this extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our bodies. For while we live, we are always being given up to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made visible in our mortal flesh.

### Psalm 71:1-14
*In te, Domine, speravi*

1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge; *\
let me never be ashamed.

2 In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *\
incline your ear to me and save me.

3 Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe; *\
you are my crag and my stronghold.

4 Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *\
from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.

5 For you are my hope, O Lord God, *\
my confidence since I was young.

6 I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;\
from my mother's womb you have been my strength; *\
my praise shall be always of you.

7 I have become a portent to many; *\
but you are my refuge and my strength.

## The Gospel

### Matthew 14:1–12

At that time Herod the ruler heard reports about Jesus; and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and for this reason these powers are at work in him.” For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” Though Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded him as a prophet. But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company, and she pleased Herod so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.” The king was grieved, yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests, he commanded it to be given; he sent and had John beheaded in the prison. The head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who brought it to her mother. His disciples came and took the body and buried it; then they went and told Jesus.
