## Owen chcuj8

I've sent you an email with your Christmas gift attached as a "pdf."

Dear Owen, Michelle, and family and friends,

The attached file contains the information you need to begin using this gift. My thought was that you would be able to be creative and perhaps enjoy it multiple times in the next year. Maybe it's a complete bust, but I hope not and my best wishes and Mele Kalikimaka are sincere.

Dear Julian,

It feels to me like you are missing from our house at Christmas time. "That's a way of saying, I wish you were here." I hope you are in some place that feels like "home" and that brings you some contentment. My hope is that you will be able to put this gift to some use that will bring you joy. Know that I love you so.
