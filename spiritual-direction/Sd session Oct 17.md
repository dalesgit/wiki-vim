	- catch up hurricane news
	- why Enneagram: personal? professional?

		- Cherrie a 4. Family providing lots of clay to Eastern Seaboard. Tampa other site. Time of retirement. Originally "tested as a 2". Her buddies are a 6 -- Presbyterian, 
		- Danny: a 5.
		- Craig: working for recovery but ok where he is. Related to Danny & Esther re. scepticism. Complication of Enneagram. Something like a foreign language. He speaks Spirituality language. 5/6 wing on several ... definitely in head category
		- Nina's cousin's body found. Funeral later. Solid 2. Empathy. Caregiver.
		- Shea is in Dallas. His home devastated in Asheville. Grieving loss of life and place. Weighs heavy. In Charlotte has power. He is a 4. Everyone he works with is a 2.

- Intro to article
	- Head center: life is a problem to be solved
	- Heart: Life is a task
	- Body: Life is a battle. Reaction, resistance, boundaries.
	- Issues
		- Head: Safety and security
		- Heart: Affection and esteem
		- Body: Control, managing
	- CH: centers of intelligence. Keating on "emotional programs for happiness" "Program for happiness"
	- Cynthia Beaurgault has a good system for integrating the 3 centers.
- Nina quoting Rohr, "we only grow through great suffering or great ?"
- What do we do with "Centers of intelligence"
	- let it become center for us ... through being curious. e.g. thinking(so and so) ... what am I feeling, What is my body saying?
	- Carol loves to make **connections**
- CH: before I "use" something on someone (SDee) I need to test it on myself.
	- e.g. your spouse or family, has an issue. Worst case scenarios in mind. Head people, some things we can't fix. Knowing that I don't know, check in with body/heart stuff. What can I do -- is gut center.
	- Hunker down in survival patterns. (children) growth into maturity a **place of inner freedom.** Self-knowledge -- freedom. The circle of Enneagram qualities of soul. Circle because possibility for full circle of ... developing capacities, inner freedom. 
	- Ask why does this matter? Growing edge for head is to tap into the heart.
	- Lines on the globe graphic are seen as pathways of **transformation**
- Nina: e.g woman's way of knowing: but data drive, (non-woman's way of knowing to describe woman's way)
- Allison now 62. She first tested for Enneagram at 25. Are there changes during a lifetime? Core type -- but the patterns that develop in the course of life, become aware of them, possibility for the patterns to relax, offer different choices.
- CH: Maya Angelou: when I did something **then** I didn't know. Now that I know I can do something different. The more I try to work the Enneagram on myself, it's not very effective. 
- Nina: How use this in SD? Danny: respond with different strategies with different "types". CH: as much as possible as SD we must allow SDee to lead. e.g. talking with someone who **needs** to think through something, the SD would be willing to have a theological conversation.
	- LS: use this if SDee brings it to the conversation. Knowledge of the E. allows us to ask questions "How does that ...?"
	- CH never brings up E. on her own -- only if SDee raises it.
	- E. has allowed her to develop antennae to notice things ... take them to heart and may or **may not bring it up.**
- Self-discovery, opening up pathways to true self, letting false self fall away, ... is a spiritual process. Truth and the grace of God allows for this blossoming. As we open ourselves to love, love is there for us. Growing up so many ways we separate ourselves from self, others, and God. Enneagram allows to re-integrate...
- LS: curious, wonder,  is like body, feelings, head. What we notice first is what our core is. But follow through with the process ... 
- [ ] CH: give her email re. how I would like the conversation about Enneagram should go.
