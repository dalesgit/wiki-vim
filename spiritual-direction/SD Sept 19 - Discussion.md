- difference between Sp. Formation and Sp Direction
- LS shared that (Friends of) Taize coming to Catholic Worker in NY when she will be there.
- Of my sharing she observed that I was mostly asking questions
- Practice she uses often in a session. Get in contemplative mode. She needs to be connected.
	- close eyes. Gently become aware of breath. Feet flat on ground, feet are tree trunks. ROoted in the ground.  Imagine roots going down.  Deep and further still. Rooted in lie source. Nourishment from the source. Clear crystal water.  Water is cleansing and refreshing. Out the top of head comes the nourishment. Sit with the flow.
- opening with [[David Whyte]]. poem "Self Portrait" (LS) a type 4 in Enneagram. God speaking through media. <https://high-road-artist.com/9574/wisdom-wednesdays/self-portrait-a-poem-by-david-whyte/>

- LS: shared a song. (the contemplative song) (our walk, with selves and others) Genesis -- "Follow you follow me".
- CS: SD is a subset of Spiritual Formation. 3rd Chair in the room. Poem: letter to Spiritual Director. Helping people to open hearts and souls to the divine.
- SF vs. SD: PowerPoint.

- assumptions: we may not all be religious, but all spiritual beings. Acknowledge of power greater than ourselves.
- 3-legs: noticing, curiosity, wonder (attention, exploring, response)
- SD: Most people are accustomed to being told who God is.
- Nina: glad to read that SD are not gurus.
- Shared screen: SDI definition from various perspectives
- SDI: "Directee" better something like "Companion" [directing is directing someone's attention]
- LS: remarked re. she is guiding a death row inmate. "God" is very problematic for him. But he is very keen on "virtues". We focus on his passion to be the best person he can be.
- LS: she lights a candle to reflect the "3rd candle" which is a basic image for SDI.
- research says ave. person has 22 sec. attention span [[listening skills]]
- who can I imagine that I would have trouble with in SD
