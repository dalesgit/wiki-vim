			- The power of loss: to shake our core beliefs
			- Loss takes many different forms
		- p. 2
			- A spiritual crisis results when the circumstances of our lives shift so drastically that all we understand about God, our world, and ourselves ...
			- We have regrets and wish it could have been different, but we know we cannotgo back and change things. We realize chat nothing is perfect, at least according to the standards we have counted on for so long. Faith communities sometimes gossip and are unsupportive; spiritual leaders betray our trust, manipulating for power and control.
			- Were We Wrong about God?
			- What could we possibly have done to deserve such pain and loss?
			- When I suffered a loss that was profound enough to shatter my lifelong understanding of who and what God was, I felt deceived, betrayed, and abandoned.
		- p. 3
			- Rupp: Theological perspectives
				- 1. God sends the loss and pain since [God] loves us and wants to strengthen our faith.
				- 2. God sends pain to punish us for some sin we have committed.
				- 3. God sends suffering to test our fidelity and to prove that we love God no matter what.
				- 4. God sends suffering for unknowable reasons. As a demonstration of faith, submission, and humility, we must accept our suffering as God's will
			- Kushner
				- 1. We do not deserve what we asked for.
				- 2. We did not pray hard enough.
				- 3. God knows what is best for us better chan we do.
				- 4. Someone else's prayer for the opposite result was more worthy
			- In fact, the rage I felt coward God arose from these very beliefs. Ironically, they are all false (Rupp, pp. 35-36). Unlearning these beliefs often comes through painful circumstances accompanied by dramatic realizations.
		- p. 4
			- According to the Spiritual Directors International Web site (www.sdiworld. org), spiritual direction is far more about companionship, guidance, and mentoring than it is about giving direction. Spiritual direction is a relationship of trust between one who guides others on their spiritual journeys and another who longs to deepen the connection with God and to discern the movement of God in her or his life.
			- when I could no longer rely on myself o¢ on my old, limiting understandings of God—when I was completely empty of any imagery or belief at all—something new emerged. This time the second bar was clearly God's willingness to meet me at the point of my complete surrender— in the very heart of my vulnerability. This new experience of God became my strength, allowing me to crust that this loving Presence would carry me forward. Even though I would not be free of the pain and fear that are a part of human experience, God would not permit me to fall
			- spiritual crisis results when the circumstances of our lives shift so drastically that all we understand about God, our world, and ourselves comes into question
		- p. 5
			- If we seek out a spiritual director, he or she is more likely to see our experience for its graced potential and help us to gain insight into what is happening to us from a spiritual perspective
			- In a dark night of the soul, alchough we are suffering an apparent loss and are grieving, we are probably not angry with God. We continue to long for an experience of the Divine Presence
				- dark night: longstanding practice; we can think of nothing but God; **apparent**  loss is really a **gain**
			- we realize chat we really would not change things, even if we could.

		  collapsed:: true
			- ### Heartening: suffering with grief is overrated
			- Heartening may be more prevalent with losses that were expected or welcomed, such as the death of a loved one who endured a prolonged, painful illness. However, even with sudden or traumatic losses, some tend to focus on the aspects of a loss experience that provides buoyancy. Doing so does not indicate that theyare not fully engaged in the grieving process.

			- n the bibliography to this article, there are links for self-inventories grievers can use to assess their tendencies and preferences for lamenting, heartening, tempering, and integrating, and to reflect on strengths, growing edges, and needs for balance in the grieving process. It can be helpful for spiritual care providers to use this self-assessment tool as well, to explore our own relationship with grief, so as to provide an important reference point on our sessions with those actively grieving.
