### Your WEPSS Responses

When you took the WEPSS, you had an opportunity to say how well certain words and phrases describe you. There were no right or wrong answers. Your total percentile scores show how much you identify with each of the nine Enneagram styles compared with how others answered the items. This measures your preferences, not necessarily your talents or skills. You also see to what extent you identify with the resourceful and less-resourceful features of each style. Go to the end of this report for suggestions about how to interpret your WEPSS results.

### Your Core Enneagram Style

Your WEPSS Total scores indicate that you identify most strongly with Style 4  as your core Enneagram style.  
  
People with a FOUR style value originality and authenticity more than anything else. You have an innate sense of quality. You want to make the world a more beautiful place, and believe this can be done by honoring your uniqueness, expressing your creativity, and deeply connecting to others and the world.  
  
Your scores indicate that you identify more with the Resourceful characteristics than the Less-Resourceful characteristics of Style FOUR. You probably have very good taste, and may be known for having a romantic and passionate view of things. It is likely that you place a high value on the inner journey, and are likely to be very sensitive to the losses and suffering of others. You value searching for and being aware of your inner real self.  
  
On the other hand, when the Less-Resourceful aspects of Style FOUR come into play, you tend to overvalue your sense of uniqueness to the extent that you only feel worthwhile if you are special and stand out from the crowd. Your sensitivity to loss may become so exaggerated that you are thrown into a state of melancholy, unable to perceive that which is not lost.  

### Your Preferred Wing Style or Neighboring Style

The preferred wing style influences the way you express your core style. Your preferred wing style is 5.  
  
You identify most strongly with the Resourceful aspects of this wing style. Your FIVE wing style helps you to balance out your intuitive, passionate, and subjective impressions with reasoned, dispassionate observations. You can achieve an unbiased perspective that helps you to temper your emotional responsiveness with an awareness of objective information.  

### What You Find Easy To Do

Each Enneagram style has adaptive characteristics that make it relatively easy to do certain things. FOURs find it easy to look inward and analyze their own inner experience. You can also easily feel empathy for others’ pain. You may find that you can effortlessly tune into the mood and spirit of your surroundings, and can express what you discover in an artistic or ritualized form.  
  
Because your Resourceful characteristics score for Style FOUR is higher than your Less-Resourceful characteristics score, it is likely that when you do look inward, you find much of value. You can thus be in tune with your own special qualities, which helps you to engage with the world from a balanced, independent stance.

### What You Find Difficult to Do or May Avoid

Each Enneagram style struggles with things that are relatively difficult to do. FOURs find it difficult to move from their fantasies and feelings into effective, purposeful action. It can be hard for you to persist through the ordinary, mundane routine that is usually required to achieve concrete goals.  

### Defensive Strategies

FOURs steer away from being ordinary by pursuing uncommon experiences and expressions. None feel as deeply as they do, none experience life in the same way they do. Mere words are not enough to express their responses; they need poetry, music, dance, painting, or some other kind of _artistic sublimation_ to capture their experience.  

### How You May Have Learned This Style

During your early development, you were very aware of your own completeness and originality. This sense became lost to you when important people in your life became unavailable to you, leading you to feel unwanted. You may have believed that this was because there was something wrong with you, or that you weren’t special enough to be noticed. You may have even felt so different from others that you believed you were delivered to the wrong planet. You tried to make yourself unique and special so that others would not leave you behind.

### What May Happen under Stressful and Unsafe Conditions

Sometimes stress brings out the best in people, and sometimes the worst. As a FOUR, your identification with the Resourceful side of Style TWO indicates that when you are stressed you may find that you can move toward others and connect with them in a mutually beneficial relationship. You may find that your strong ability to empathize with others allows you to be of genuine service to them. You need to be alert to feelings of resentment when your efforts are not acknowledged to the extent that you would like.

### What May Happen Under Relaxed and Secure Conditions

When people feel safe, secure, and relaxed, they can often express their positive side more readily than usual. Sometimes, though, in times of security they are more willing to show their flaws. As a FOUR, your identification with the Resourceful side of Style ONE indicates that when you are feeling secure you have a sense of your wholeness and worth when you look inward. This enables you to be more accepting of your flaws so that you don’t rely so much on the attention of others to feel complete. It can also make it easier for you to stay grounded in reality and to take action to resolve inner turmoil. You need to be alert to a tendency to lose yourself in idealistic, romantic fantasies.  

### How You Can Be More in Balance

Your sense of inner wholeness is a great resource you can use to stay in balance. Rely on your inner wisdom and ability to be objective to help you remain calm in the face of deficiencies and disappointments. You can use your altruism and sensitivity to others’ feelings to help you develop balanced relationships. Your ability to perceive the basic goodness in yourself and in others can help you keep your balance in relationships and resolve problems in a focused, solution-oriented manner.

### Alternative Types

If you feel that style 4 does not really reflect you, you may want to look at your second or third highest style ([style 2](https://www.wepss.com/results.asp?tid=RXUF6FAf&origin=email&alt=etype2) or [style 5](https://www.wepss.com/results.asp?tid=RXUF6FAf&origin=email&alt=etype3)).

### HOW TO INTERPRET YOUR WEPSS RESULTS

If your **highest total score** stands out above all the rest, it is likely to be the style you most identify with.

- If several high scores are close, you might also want to consider your second and third highest scores. 97% of test takers tend to most identify with one of their top three styles.
- You can now click and view your report as if your 2nd or 3rd highest scores were your preferred or core style.
- Which one of these configurations or patterns describes you the best?

Are many of your scores high (Above 80%)? In the middle (40-60%)? Low (below 20%)?

- If all the scores are **high**, you might have a test-taking mindset of endorsing everything with passion and gusto. Everything really fits you.
- If most of your scores are in the **middle**, you might not favor extreme endorsements, high or low.
- If all the scores are **low**, you might have a test-taking mindset of denying everything. Nothing really fits you. Maybe you are not sure what fits you. Or maybe you don’t want to disclose what fits you.

Do you identify mostly with the **resourceful** or **less-resourceful** thoughts, feelings, behaviors of each type?  
  
Which **wing** or **neighboring style** do you identify with? Resourceful? Or not-so-resourceful?  

Do you go to the resourceful or less-resourceful side of the style you access and use when you are **balanced**, relaxed, and optimally functioning (style preceding yours going against the direction of the arrow)? And do you utilize the high (resourceful) or low (less-resourceful) side of the style you default to when you are **stressed**, upset, and defensively reacting (style proceeding from yours in the direction of the arrow)?

  
  
If you identify with many **resourceful scores**:

- You may be healthy and well-rounded.
- You may have answered how you wish you were instead of how you actually are.
- You may have an inflated notion of how good you are.
- You may be faking good and attempting to put yourself in a positive light.

**Resourceful scores** attempt to measure the high side or positive features of each style.

- The resourceful qualities of each style represent healthy adaptations and effective choices with little or no harmful side effects. They lead to happiness, fulfillment, and satisfying relationships. In Abraham Maslow’s terms, these strengths flow from Being and are expressions of _Being-needs_ and _Being-motivations_. For example, Being-love flows from an abundance of goodness in the person. It is like a spring bubbling up and flowing out from within. Or, music, etc., is in you and it just wants to come out. Maslow lists fifteen _Being-Values_. The Enneagram has nine sets: **goodness/rightness; love/nurturance; efficacy/competence; beauty/authenticity; truth/wisdom; fidelity/constancy; joy/positivity; justice/strength; unity/peace.**

If you identify with many **less-resourceful scores**:

- You may have answered how you were over long periods of your life instead of how you are now. (This is actually the best way to assess your type. We tend to overwork our style in our teen and emerging adult years.)
- You may be someone who is very critical of themselves.
- You may be in a stressful time in your life.
- You may be asking for help.

**Less-resourceful scores** attempt to measure the low side or negative features of each style.

- The less-resourceful qualities of each style represent maladaptive or even neurotic survival and defensive techniques that have collateral damage or side effects. They work or we wouldn’t keep using them. But they come at a cost (anxiety, depression, frustration, alienation, et.al.) In Maslow’s terms they arise from _Deficiency_ and are expressions of _Deficiency-needs_ and _Deficiency-motivations_. For example, Deficiency-love comes from a lack that wants to be filled. I love you because I need to feel needed or because I need your love to feel good about myself. Deficiency-needs are like an empty well that needs filling from outside. Unfortunately, the well leaks so it needs to be continually refilled.

**Shift from Resourceful to Less-Resourceful**

- The less-resourceful expressions of each style are often just _exaggerations_ of healthy strategies. At the core of every neurosis is a healthy striving that got distorted. _Hamartia_, the Greek word for sin, means missing the mark. It implies that there was something good there to begin with –something that was on target. But if we overdo a good thing, it becomes a liability. For example:
    - Wanting to be good can be exaggerated into striving for perfection.
    - Wanting to love and be needed can lead to co-dependence.
    - Wanting to accomplish and achieve can accelerate into workaholism.
    - Wanting to be authentic can be distorted into needing to be special and out-of-the-ordinary.
    - Wanting to be wise can over-emphasize being rational and intellectual.
    - Wanting to be faithful can morph into fanaticism, us vs. them.
    - Wanting to be joyful and optimistic can expand into Pollyannish pleasure- seeking and pain-avoidance.
    - Wanting to be strong can inflate into being aggressive and a bully.
    - Wanting to be harmonious can lead to conflict-avoidance and peace at any cost.

Think of the metaphor: we begin in paradise or our essence (1st 50 resourceful items); we lose our way, forgetting who we are, and our ego tries to make up for and substitute for what we mistakenly believe we lost --namely our real self (middle 100 less-resourceful items); we experience transformation, redemption, or recovery and return to paradise, our essence. We realize we possessed what we were looking for all along (last 50 resourceful items).

Here’s another metaphor: we have nine players on our outer team (those people around us) and we have nine players on our inner team (those talents and strengths we have within us).

**High scores** might well represent those maneuvers you are most familiar and skilled with, most trust, and are most likely to use. They might also represent what you value the most, what is important to you. When you look back over your day, what made it a good day? For example: Did you do something well? Help someone? Get a lot done? Have a deep conversation? Learn something? Kept your word? Have an adventure? Stand up for what you believe in? Bring about a reconciliation? Also, what do you contribute to a group? What do you have a facility for? What comes easy to you? What is your intuitive edge? What do you see clearly or before anyone else considers it? What would be missing if your style weren’t there?

**Low scores** might represent underutilized parts of yourself. Maybe you are afraid of these parts, uncomfortable with them, awkward in expressing them, found they were disapproved of when you were younger, etc. You have nine players on your inner team but may only put the highest scoring players into the game. Those other parts, perhaps in your shadow, may have something to contribute that you’re not aware of or not adept at. They might be very useful in certain circumstances. It’s good to recognize, value, and cultivate all nine styles with their attributes that are in you. Practice, practice, practice. Act _as if_ you were that style.  
  
**Your scores** show you how much you identify percentile-wise with each style. The more you can see situations from all points of view and the more strategies you have available to you, the clearer will be your vision and the more effective your responses will be. [Click here to see detailed descriptions of all nine styles.](https://enneagramspectrum.com/enneagram-styles/)  
  
Three last metaphors:

- From a _psychological point of view_, we have at least nine useful ways of looking at the world and nine adaptive strategies for surviving, thriving and contributing to our group.
- From a _business point of view,_, our main organizing style is our _Chief Executive Officer_ and _Chief Operating Officer_. The remaining eight styles are our _Board of Directors_. Consulting with them regularly will keep us in business.
- From a _spiritual point of view_, we possess and manifest at least nine aspects of divinity or gifts of the spirit. Don’t hide those gifts under a bushel, but open up your presents (and presence) and share them with us.

The resourceful characteristics and ideals of each style are contrasted with their non-resourceful idealizations.
