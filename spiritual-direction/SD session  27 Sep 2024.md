  - This session
    - What has this session been? LS asked.
    - Title: Rather than finding God in all things, instead Finding all things in God. i.e. Panentheism.
    - I found tension and growth in the lectio question: "Having heard what God is saying in ..., What does God want you to do or be?" LS: doesn't have to be an action or a decision but something to be. e.g. Gratitude.
    - Where I had seen **conversion** e.g. with Walt Wade -- given my wrestling with conservative Evangelicalism -- I could see the privilege of witnessing God's loving action, Redemptive healing.
    - **Witnessing** as one of the metaphors for what SD is.
    - She asked me what is God doing in the "nostalgia", retrospective, larger perspective all the things of my life seem to showing?
      - I thought maybe getting to a kind of peacefulness, resting, in the whole trajectory of my life.
      - St. Augustine: "We are restless ..." seen in the context not of death, but of the life we are living.
    - She affirmed that in the act of my nostalgia, memory-driven thoughts, I seek to find **meaning** -- not just **facts**.
    - When I told her that the tree experience led me to _The Giving Tree_, she said that it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> time she had heard reference to it. She smiled a big smile.
    - I thought at another time that a pregnant experience I thought of for blogging was the tenderness, generosity, intimacy, â€¦ the nurse at my colonoscopy who volunteered to braid my hair. Blog it?
