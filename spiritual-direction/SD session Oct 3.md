	- 25 years ago doing Spiritual Exercises. Her SD (an SJ) told her to listen to that song.
	- "Welcoming Prayer" guided meditation
	- Annie's song is jumping into the relationship with God, friendship, love, with all of who I am. 
	- "What might God be doing or saying the **static**?"
	- Danny & wife is reading "Peace is every step" by Thich Nat Hanh -- focusing on the breath

## Stages of Faith (James Fowler)
- Chart
- She is #4 but gravitates to #1 (likes chart)
-  Next section *Faith Styles* as opposed to **stages**
- Pay attention to where the directee is feeling uncomfortable, that suggests possibility of needing to move to new stage
- *The Gods must be crazy* dropped from airplane into village in Africa -- the gods must have sent it to us. It causes conflict in the village. God's must be angry. Black / White thinkers. Lasting images. 
- She will send chart to us.
- cf. Erickson each stage gives us something important to take with us (Cherie)
- How frame **evocative questions**?
- LS: a lot of those coming to SD are in Stage 3. They are de-constructing their faith and wanting to move on. Stage 4 is re-constructive
- LS: Also many in stage 4. cf. John of the Cross: 1) Purgative stage 2) Illuminative stage (stage 4) 3) Unitive stage
- Asking, "Is it just me, or is it God?" Ignatius would say, "It's always you. The question is 'What Spirit is talking to you?'"
- cf. Rohr in *Naked Now*, p. 164-165 -- 9 stages. 
- Stages as **layers of an onion**
- St. Bernard : 1st stage of love. "Love of God  for the sake of ..." 
- Stages work until they don't work any more.
- LS: thinks the SD of Mother Teresa decision to publish her letters was wrong, wrong, wrong.

| 1        | words/meaning      | ask a friend to name the 5 words we most often say                                                      |
|          | "experience"       | What makes an experience religious                                                                      |
| 1-b      | human experience   | perception, reaction, results                                                                           |

| 2        | 1st component      | perception of something                                                                                 |
|          | 2nd component      | reaction: exp. is an encounter, rooted in senses                                                        |
|          | 3rd comp           | results: however inconsequential or momentous, human exp. inevitably changes us in some way             |
|          | assume             | SD can get into difficulties when they begin to infer or assume specifics from directee's generalities. |

|          |                    | We believe that  we can never  encounter God immediately but that everything  can  reveal God  to us.   |
|          | interior dimension | religious => inner. Onlooker might not see anything.                                                    |
|          | SD                 | helps people to see what is there                                                                       |
| 4        | not ready          | just because people believe something doesn't mean they will experience it                              |

|          | Ignatian           | intellectual or discursive                                                                              |
|          |                    | or imaginative and feeling oriented                                                                     |

|          |                    | though the community may well not confirm the person's religious experience and results                 |
- > As we look at these elements,  we will see  that experience is more an encounter between a person and some reality than it is something that happens to an  individual. There are always two involved, even if the other is some inner reality. Experience is relational at heart.

- > In his book *Spiritual Direction and the Encounter with God*, William A. Barry develops the notion of ex- perience as multidimensional  and  speaks of the reli- gious dimension  of experience.

- > We believe that  we can never  encounter God im- mediately but that everything  can  reveal God  to us.
- **Perception**: > The religious dimension of experience is an interior dimension.  An onlooker  might see a per- son praying under his or her breath but have no idea what that person is experiencing.
- > Spiritual direction  helps  pcople  to perceive  what  is there, to  look within,  to  notice and  attend  to  the  re- alities of  this religious  dimension  of life.

- > On the other hand, believing and readying our- selves for God's revelation does not ensure that we will experience it.

- > Let us look specifically at two  reactions that arise constantly in the dialague of spiritual direction. When people speak of their prayer, they often talk cither about their feelings (whether they are the pos- itive feelings aroused by “good”prayer or  the negative ones,like boredom,fretfulness,and irritability,that seem to lurk around every prayer corner) or about their thoughts (whether they are reflections on what happened during prayer or on what ought to be done because of it).

- > has a puzzling reputation.Some see Ignatian prayer as intellectual and discursive, while for others it is all imagination and feeling.

- -> A first result of genuine  experience of God is th God becomes a more real person for me.

- > Experience of God involves a person more deeply in the real community with all its brokenness, sin, and injustice, as well as its reflections of God's glory.

- > Because Christians can  be as short- sighted and selfish  as anyone else,  this is a difficult criterion to employ  in practice:  real religious experi- ence often flies  in the face of values  adopted by the re- ligious community.

- > The events and encounters of relationship give sub- stance to one's thoughts and feelings.To know that God loves me is a very good thing. To experience God's embrace or God's persistence despite my sins is something else again. Life with God is no more ab- stract than life with one another, and there is more to this kind of relationship than just  love. God has a per- sonality,and a sense of humor as well as a sense of purpose; God is a real Person with independent de- sires and concerns. Religious experience is important for praying people because relating with God a God who has chosen to be known in our time onth is Earth,and not only in our thoughts and desires is at the heart of life.
