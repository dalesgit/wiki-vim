- ### What is contemplation
  > Whatis contemplation?We arenot  here using the word in its mystic almeaning. We are using it ina sensethat iscloser tothe meani ngIgnatius of Loyola gave itwhen he proposed (in his Spiri- tualExercises)that peoplelook atJesus ashe appearsin gospel  events andlet themselvesbecome absorbedin what he islike, what he cares about, and whathe isdoing,

- ### Contemplative prayer
  > Contemplative prayer, as we use  the term here, means paying attention to and becoming at least slightly absorbed in the person of Jesus, in God, or in biblical persons or out standing Christians.
  
  [[Fostering-the-Contemplative-Attitude---Sep-8-2024---4-19-PM--feqbp_ocr-combined.pdf#page=3&annotation=737R|Fostering-the-Contemplative-Attitude---Sep-8-2024---4-19-PM--feqbp_ocr-combined, page 3]]
- ### above all "look" "listen" -- Pay attention
  > And all these activities, while good in themselves, tend to preclude looking and listening.

  > Thus, one effect of paying attention to something outside ourselves is that it can make us forget ourselves and our surroundings. Contem- plation leads to, or rather is an experience of, transcendence4that is, of forgetfulness of self and of everyone and everything else except the contemplated object.

- ### self-absorption gets in the way
  > Conversely, self-absorption makes the contemplation of anything or anyone else very difficult, if not impossible. Thus, a starving man will not enjoy a sunset.

  > Spiritual directors sometimes have to work long and patiently with pcople to help them reach the point of being able to forget them- selves.

  > Spiritual directors encourage their directees to ask for what they want from God.

  > The actual experience of transcendence falls somewhere be- tween total self-absorption and total absorption in the other. In any human experience there  is bound to be a mixture  of both self- consciousness and awareness of the outside world.
- ### Nature and scripture
  
  > Nature and the Scriptures are the privi- leged places most often recommended by spiritual directors and so deserve particular attention.

  > We can look at the contemplation of **Scripture** in a similar way. Scripture is not God, but  a privileged place to mect  God. However, one must pay attention  to Scripture in  the same way  that in the  con- templation of  nature one  has to pay  attention to  trees or sunsets  or mountains.

  > It is not finally helpful for prayer or Christian living to base it on a delusion. Hence, it is important to see the gospels for what they are. They are not biographics of Jesus, but four different expressions of the faith of the early Church and what it remembered  in faith  about Jesus.
