### This is not seminary
- like sipping a fine wine (SD training)
- It's not what you know, come with a beginners mind
- some things that you already know some things we don't know. A new way of hearing the old.
- K. Leech inward as well as outward (prophetic)
### Principles
- not everyone is religious, but all have spiritual
- interiority is essential to our work
- what they bring is authenticall their experience
- Sipping wine not chugging beer
- Feel free to bring other things into class
- What exactly a **faux verbatim**
	- make up a directee
	- we choose the issue
	- pretend you are directing them
	- "Verbatims are always lies, but they are your lies."
	- They key: keep journal with the prompts. If you learn nothing else, this is sufficient. It sounds so easy but it is diffiult.
	- Neuro plasticity. Learn new ways to think. Retraining the brain.
