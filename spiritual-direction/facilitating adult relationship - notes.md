## adult relationship
- > All my life as a spiritual director  and as a writer has been preoccupied with the kind of relationship God wants with us human beings.

> Recently I have come to believe that what God wants with adults is a relationship that **matches their maturity**. That is, God wants a friendship that accords with what ever level of friendship a person is capable of. (LS focused on the emphasis in response to my statement about **should**. We should have a mature relationship, have a mature conversion...)
## The Dynamics of friendship
> First of all, something attracted  you to these  friends, and something in you attracted them.
> You spend time with the potential friend in order human, frail, and fearful. Buc if it does, it can last a life- to get to know one another.

Spending time in order to get to know one another.
No friendship, ... remains in this **honeymoon** period forever.

## Stages in the growth of friendship
- Friends who have gone through the turbulence of the post honeymoon period may now begin to think of doing things together.

	- n.b. the shift in imagining adult children (with parents) 
	- These adult children (of parents) are invited into God's **family business**
### Ignatian insight
1. Ignatius Loyola in "Contemplation to Obtain Love"
	1. Love ought to manifest more by deeds than words
	2. Love consists in **mutual** communication.
2. God desires something from us -- to cooperate with God.
3. > We will not have peace on earth unless we human beings allow our hearts to be transformed into forgiving, caring hearts.

## conversation
- Barry died during Covid
- co-creation, co-laboring. LS: people don't think in those terms
	- back of the bicycle moment
	- present a concept, but get off the bicycle right away (get out of the way)
- God wants our friendship at whatever we are capable of -- whatever stage we're at. (p. ??)
- Danny: troubled by word **friendship** because of the baggage the word means in his own background 
	- SD: don't make assumptions. Don't label.
- St. Francis: Oh God, who are you. Oh God, who am I. (sufficient for spiritual growth.)
