I'm not sure what to think about dictation in the Chromebook. The article is poignant in saying that Spiritual direction is neither spiritual nor direction. Which is to say it is not **self explanatory**.

[[art-of-spiritual-direction]] with notes

- Role of prayer
- Listening is primary "mode"
- Directee's **experience** is primary
- Trust (on both sides) is fundamental to the relationship working. Trust is multi-faceted and is itself a gift.
- probing **feelings** is province of psychotherapy, but not without relevance in SD. E.g. how the directee is experiencing **trust** is primary 
	- "People beginning to be aware of their experience of God are not usually consistent in their willingness to trust the experience enough to build on it"
- The task of director is **facilitative**
- "The process of direction takes place on the ground of the directeeâ€™s life and prayer. It changes ground as the directee's life and relationship with God"
- "Grief, chagrin, and resentment are powerful emotions that can absorb our attention like quicksand"
- "One way to look at the ongoing relationship with God, the struggle between God and the directee to continue meeting each other, is to compare it to a dance. A man reading these pages may easily recall the anxiety he felt the first time he searched a dance floor for the person he most wanted to approach"
