### Psalm 8

*Domine, Dominus noster*

1 O Lord our **Governor**, *  
how exalted is your Name in all the **world**!

2 Out of the mouths of infants and **children** *  
your majesty is praised above the **heavens**.

3 You have set up a stronghold against your **adversaries**, *  
to quell the enemy and the a**venger**.

4 When I consider your heavens, the work of your **fingers**, *  
the moon and the stars you have set in their **courses**,

5 What is man that you should be **mindful of him**? *  
the son of man that you should seek him **out**?

6 You have made him but little lower than the **angels**; *  
you adorn him with glory and **honor**;

7 You give him mastery over the works of your **hands**; *  
you put all things under his **feet**:

8 All sheep and **oxen**, *  
even the wild beasts of the **field**,

9 The birds of the air, the fish of the **sea**, *  
and whatsoever walks in the paths of the **sea**.

10 O Lord our **Governor**, *  
how exalted is your Name in all the **world**!
