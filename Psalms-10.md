Thursday morning prayer
Psalm 80
Gather your strength, O God, come, save us, Shepherd of Israel.

Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, leader of Joseph's flock.

From your throne on the cherubim shine out for Ephraim, for Benjamin and Manasseh.

Gather your strength, come, save us!

Restore to us, God, the light of your presence, and we shall be saved.

How long, Lord God of might, will you smoulder with rage, despite our prayers?

For bread you feed us tears, we drink them by the barrel.

You let our neighbors mock, our enemies scorn us.

Restore to us, God of might, the light of your presence, and we shall be saved.

You brought a vine from Egypt, cleared out nations to plant it; you prepared the ground and made it take root to fill the land.

It overshadowed the mountains, towered over the mighty cedars, stretched its branches to the sea, its roots to the distant river.

Why have you now torn down its walls?

All who pass by steal the grapes, wild boars tear up its roots, beasts devour its fruit.

Turn our way, God of might, look down from heaven; tend this vine you planted, cherish it once more.

May those who slashed and burned it wither at your rebuke.

Rest your hand upon your chosen one who draws strength from you.

We have not turned from you.

Give us life again

and we will invoke your name.

Restore to us, Lord God of might, the light of your presence, and we shall be saved. •

Psalm 81

Shout joy to God, the God of our strength.

Shout joy to God, the God of our strength, sing to the God of Jacob.

Lift hearts, strike tambourines, sound lyre and harp.

Blow trumpets at the New Moon, till the full moon of our feast.

For this is a law for Israel, the command of Jacob's God, decreed for the house of Joseph when we marched from Egypt.

We heard a voice unknown:

"I lifted burdens from your backs, a blistering load from your hands.

"You cried out in pain and I rescued you; robed in thunder, I answered you.

At the waters of Meribah

I tested you.

"My people, hear my complaint;

Israel, if you would only listen.

You shall have no other gods, do not bow before them.

I am the Lord your God.

I brought you out of Egypt and fed your hungry mouths.

"But you would not hear me, my people rejected me.

So I hardened your hearts, and you left me out of your plans.

My people, if you would only listen!

Israel, walk in my ways!

"Then I will strike your enemy, and put them all to flight.

With their fate sealed,

my foes will grovel at your feet.

But you, O Israel, will feast on finest wheat, will savor pure wild honey." O

Thursday evening prayer
Psalm 72:1-11
THURSDAY EVENING PRAYER

I have made you the light of all nations to carry my salvation to the ends of the earth.

God, give your king judgment, the son of the king your sense of what is right; help him judge your people and do right for the powerless.

May mountains bear peace, hills bring forth justice.

May the king defend the poor, set their children free, and kill their oppressors.

May he live as long as the sun, as long as the moon, for ever.

May he be like rain on a field, like showers that soak the earth.

May justice sprout in his time, peace till the moon is no more.

May he rule from sea to sea,

from the River to the ends of the earth.

Enemies will cower before him, they will lick the dust.

Kings from Tarshish and the islands will bring their riches to him.

Kings of Sheba, kings of Saba will carry gifts to him.

All kings will bow before him, all the nations serve him. •

Psalm 72:12-19
The king will rescue the poor, will save their lives from violence.

He will rescue the poor at their call, those no one speaks for.

Those no one cares for he hears and will save, save their lives from violence, lives precious in his eyes.

Every day they pray for him and bless him all his life.

Long life to him!

Gold to him from Saba!

May wheat be thick in the fields, fruit trees sway on the slope.

May cities teem with people, thick as the forests of Lebanon.

May his name live on for ever, live as long as the sun.

May all find blessing in him, and he be blest by all.

Blessed be Israel's God, Lord of wonderful deeds!

Bless God's name for ever!

Let God's glory fill the world!

Amen and Amen! O

Friday Morning Prayer
Psalm 51
FRIDAY MORNING PRAYER

You welcome a changed heart, O God.

Have mercy, tender God, forget that I defied you.

Wash away my sin, cleanse me from my guilt.

I know my evil well, it stares me in the face, evil done to you alone before your very eyes.

How right your condemnation!

Your verdict clearly just.

You see me for what 1 am, a sinner before my birth.

You love those centered in truth; teach me your hidden wisdom.

Wash me with fresh water, wash me bright as snow.

Fill me with happy songs,

let the bones you bruised now dance.

Shut your eyes to my sin, make my guilt disappear.

Creator, reshape my heart,

God, steady my spirit.

Do not cast me aside stripped of your holy spirit.

Save me, bring back my joy, support me, strengthen my will.

Then I will teach your way and sinners will turn to you.

Help me, stop my tears, and I will sing your goodness.

Lord, give me words

and I will shout your praise.

When I offer a holocaust, the gift does not please you.

So I offer my shattered spirit; a changed heart you welcome.

In your love make Zion lovely, rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

Then sacrifice will please you, young bulls upon your altar. D

Psalm 147:12-20
Jerusalem, give glory to God!

Jerusalem, give glory!

Praise God with song, O Zion!

For the Lord strengthens your gates guarding your children within.

The Lord fills your land with peace, giving you golden wheat.

God speaks to the earth, the word speeds forth.

The Lord sends heavy snow and scatters frost like ashes.

The Lord hurls chunks of hail.

Who can stand such cold?

God speaks, the ice melts;

God breathes, the streams flow.

God speaks his word to Jacob, to Israel, his laws and decrees.

God has not done this for others, no others receive this wisdom.

Hallelujah!o

Friday evening prayer
Psalm 116:1-9
God rescues me from death, steadying my feet.

I am filled with love, for the Lord hears me; the Lord bends to my voice whenever I call.

Death had me in its grip, the grave's trap was set, grief held me fast.

I cried out for God,

"Please, Lord, rescue me!"

Kind and faithful is the Lord, gentle is our God.

The Lord shelters the poor, raises me from the dust.

Rest once more, my heart, for you know the Lord's love.

God rescues me from death, wiping my tears, steadying my feet.

I walk with the Lord in this land of the living. •

Psalm 121
My help is the Lord, who made earth and the heavens.

If I look to the mountains, will they come to my aid?

My help is the Lord, who made earth and the heavens.

May God, ever wakeful, keep you from stumbling; the guardian of Israel neither rests nor sleeps.

God shields you,

a protector by your side.

The sun shall not harm you by day nor the moon at night.

God shelters you from evil, securing your life.

God watches over you near and far, now and always. •
Saturday Morning Prayer
Psalm 92
SATURDAY MORNING PRAYER

How good to sing your love at dawn, your faithfulness at dusk.

How good to thank you, Lord, to praise your name, Most High, to sing your love at dawn, your faithfulness at dusk with sound of lyre and harp, with music of the lute.

For your work brings delight, your deeds invite song.

I marvel at what you do.

Lord, how deep your thought!

Fools do not grasp this, nor the senseless understand.

Scoundrels spring up like grass, flourish and quickly wither.

You, Lord, stand firm for ever.

See how your enemies perish, scattered to the winds,

while you give me brute strength, pouring rich oil upon me.

I have faced my enemies, heard them plot against me.
The just grow tall like palm trees, majestic like cedars of Lebanon.

They are planted in the temple courts and flourish in God's house, green and heavy with fruit even in old age.

Proclaim that God is just, my rock without a fault. •

Psalm 8
Lord our God, the whole world tells the greatness of your name.

Lord our God, the whole world tells the greatness of your name.

Your glory reaches beyond the stars.

Even the babble of infants declares your strength, your power to halt the enemy and avenger.

I see your handiwork in the heavens:

the moon and the stars you set in place.

What is humankind that you remember them, the human race

that you care for them?

You treat them like gods, dressing them in glory and splendor.

You give them charge of the earth, laying all at their feet:

cattle and sheep, wild beasts,

birds of the sky, fish of the sea,

every swimming creature.

Lord our God, the whole world tells the greatness of your name.
