*Reflection for Spiritual Direction Course*

1. **I notice…(awareness)** I have relied on my basic intuition in exchanges with parishioners and others through the years. The SD course invites me to get intentional and knowledgeable. I scared about my diminished ability to remember (memorize) stuff. 
2. **I’m curious about… (attentive exploration)** What should I do about my clearly approaching diminishment? e.g. I couldn't memorize a piano piece, as hard as I tried.
3. **I wonder how I can… (active response)** 
- tools, e.g. Obsidian PDF management, 
- acknowledging my weakness
- Today at the gym I thought that the work I put in is intended not to strengthen or progress, but to slow down the decline.
- What about Yoda?
