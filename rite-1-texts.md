## Salutation

*The people standing, the Celebrant may say*

|   |   |
|---|---|
||Blessed be God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.|
|People|And blessed be his kingdom, now and for ever.  <br>Amen.|

In place of the above, from Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Celebrant|Alleluia. Christ is risen.|
|People|The Lord is risen indeed. Alleluia.|

*In Lent and on other penitential occasions*

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Celebrant|Bless the Lord who forgiveth all our sins;|
|People|His mercy endureth for ever.|

*The Celebrant says*

Almighty God, unto whom all hearts are open, all desires  known, and from whom no secrets are hid: Cleanse the  thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit,  that we may perfectly love thee, and worthily magnify thy  holy Name; through Christ our Lord. _Amen._

*Then the Ten Commandments (page [317](https://www.bcponline.org/HE/decaloguet.html)) may be said, or the following*

Hear what our Lord Jesus Christ saith:  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with  all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great  commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt  love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments  hang all the Law and the Prophets.

*Here is sung or said*

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Lord, have mercy upon us.||Kyrie eleison.|
|Christ, have mercy upon us.|or|Christe eleison.|
|Lord, have mercy upon us.||Kyrie eleison.|

*or this*

Holy God,  
Holy and Mighty,  
Holy Immortal One,  
_Have mercy upon us._

*When appointed, the following hymn or some other song of praise is  sung or said, in addition to, or in place of, the preceding, all standing*

Glory be to God on high,  
    and on earth peace, good will towards men.

We praise thee, we bless thee,  
    we worship thee,  
    we glorify thee,  
    we give thanks to thee for thy great glory,  
O Lord God, heavenly King, God the Father Almighty.

O Lord, the only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ;  
O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,  
    that takest away the sins of the world,  
    have mercy upon us.

Thou that takest away the sins of the world,  
    receive our prayer.  
Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the Father,  
    have mercy upon us.

For thou only art holy;  
thou only art the Lord;  
thou only, O Christ,  
    with the Holy Ghost,  
    art most high in the glory of God the Father. Amen.

## **Confession of Sin**

*A Confession of Sin is said here if it has not been said earlier. On  occasion, the Confession may be omitted.*

*The Deacon or Celebrant says the following, or else the Exhortation  on page [316](https://www.bcponline.org/HE/exhortation.html).*

Ye who do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins, and  are in love and charity with your neighbors, and intend to  lead a new life, following the commandments of God, and  walking from henceforth in his holy ways: Draw near with  faith, and make your humble confession to Almighty God,  devoutly kneeling.

*or this*

Let us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.

*Silence may be kept.*

Minister and People

Almighty God,  Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  maker of all things, judge of all men:  We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins      and wickedness,  which we from time to time most grievously have committed,  by thought, word, and deed, against thy divine Majesty,  provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us.  We do earnestly repent,  and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings;  the remembrance of them is grievous unto us,  the burden of them is intolerable.  Have mercy upon us,  have mercy upon us, most merciful Father;  for thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake,  forgive us all that is past;  and grant that we may ever hereafter  serve and please thee in newness of life,  to the honor and glory of thy Name;  through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

*or this*

Most merciful God,  we confess that we have sinned against thee  in thought, word, and deed,  by what we have done,  and by what we have left undone.  We have not loved thee with our whole heart;  we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.  We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.  For the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ,  have mercy on us and forgive us;  that we may delight in thy will,  and walk in thy ways,  to the glory of thy Name. Amen.


*The Bishop when present, or the Priest, stands and says*

Almighty God, our heavenly Father, who of his great mercy  hath promised forgiveness of sins to all those who with  hearty repentance and true faith turn unto him, have mercy  upon you, pardon and deliver you from all your sins, confirm  and strengthen you in all goodness, and bring you to  everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen._

## Offertory

*A Minister may then say one or more of the following [sentences](https://www.bcponline.org/HE/offsenthe1.html), first saying*

Hear the Word of God to all who truly turn to him.

Come unto me, all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and   I will refresh you.    _Matthew 11:28_

God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son,  to the end that all that believe in him should not perish, but  have everlasting life.    _John 3:16_

If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus  Christ the righteous; and he is the perfect offering for our  sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole  world.    _1 John 2:1-2_

Lord, hear the prayers of _thy_ people; and what we have  
asked faithfully, grant that we may obtain effectually, to the  
glory of _thy_ Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. _Amen._

### 2

Heavenly Father, you have promised to hear what we ask in  
the Name of your Son: Accept and fulfill our petitions, we  
pray, not as we ask in our ignorance, nor as we deserve in our  
sinfulness, but as you know and love us in your Son Jesus  
Christ our Lord. _Amen._

### 3

Almighty and eternal God, ruler of all things in heaven and  
earth: Mercifully accept the prayers of your people, and  
strengthen us to do your will; through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
_Amen._

### 4

Almighty God, to whom our needs are known before we ask:  
Help us to ask only what accords with your will; and those


good things which we dare not, or in our blindness cannot  
ask, grant us for the sake of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord.  
_Amen._

### 5

O Lord our God, accept the fervent prayers of your people; in  
the multitude of your mercies, look with compassion upon us  
and all who turn to you for help; for you are gracious, O  
lover of souls, and to you we give glory, Father, Son, and  
Holy Spirit, now and for ever. _Amen._

### 6

Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, "Peace I give to  
you; my own peace I leave with you:" Regard not our sins,  
but the faith of your Church, and give to us the peace and  
unity of that heavenly City, where with the Father and the  
Holy Spirit you live and reign, now and for ever. _Amen._

### 7

Hasten, O Father, the coming of thy kingdom; and grant that  
we thy servants, who now live by faith, may with joy behold  
thy Son at his coming in glorious majesty; even Jesus Christ,  
our only Mediator and Advocate. _Amen._

### 8

Almighty God, by your Holy Spirit you have made us one  
with your saints in heaven and on earth: Grant that in our  
earthly pilgrimage we may always be supported by this  
fellowship of love and prayer, and know ourselves to be  
surrounded by their witness to your power and mercy. We  
ask this for the sake of Jesus Christ, in whom all our  
intercessions are acceptable through the Spirit, and who lives  
and reigns for ever and ever. _Amen._
