On this Mother’s Day, we give thanks to God for the divine gift of motherhood in all its diverse forms. 

Let us pray for all the mothers among us today; for our own mothers, those living and those who have passed away; for the mothers who loved us and for those who fell short of loving us fully; for all who hope to be mothers someday and for those whose hope to have children has been frustrated; for all the mothers who have lost children; for all women and men who have mothered others in any way–those who have been our substitute mothers and we who have done so for those in need; and for the earth that bore us and provides us with our sustenance. 

We pray this all in the name of God, our great and loving Mother. *Amen*.
