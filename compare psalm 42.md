## Banned psalm

As a deer craves running water,\
I thirst for you, my God;\
I thirst for God,\
the living God.\
When will I see your face?

Tears are my steady diet.\
Day and night I hear,\
"Where is your God?"

I cry my heart out,\
I remember better days:\
when I entered the house of God,\
I was caught in the joyful sound \
of pilgrims giving thanks.
## NRSV 
1 As the deer pants for streams of water,\
    so my soul pants for you, my God.\
2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.\
    When can I go and meet with God?\
3 My tears have been my food\
    day and night,\
while people say to me all day long,\
    “Where is your God?”\
4 These things I remember\
    as I pour out my soul:\
how I used to go to the house of God\
    under the protection of the Mighty One[d]\
with shouts of joy and praise\
    among the festive throng.
