Is she *stuck* emotionally? Why wouldn't she be in Bridget's clutches.

## Thought to say:

I am mostly bewildered by the silence. And I think it is not my place to try to fix it. As I take it you do as well. Is it adequate to say something like, "Whatever happens, I want good things for you." You don't owe me anything. I ask forgiveness for all the things I've done to hurt you.

You were so brave to have figured out a way to invite me to your graduation and then, later, to your wedding. Thank you.
