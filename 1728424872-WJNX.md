# obsidian-nvim

- main web site  <https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim>
- This has good configuration info <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Lmyh0YRH-w>
- "Why I switched" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCzSPHrLBoU>
- How I use <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDAYePbuMMs>
- The holy grail of note-taking <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ht8NYkU9wQ>

I have integrated the options from the main web site. Seems to be working. Looks pretty powerfully.

The web site describes how to use templates. That fixes the awkwardness I have experienced with trying to duplicate work of wiki-vim.
