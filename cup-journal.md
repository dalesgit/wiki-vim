- # journaling the cup
- ## Fri 20 Sep 2024 (Day 6)
  Empty cup. Empty chair. Now I know that the __empty chair__ is a symbol for God in the [SD](SD.md)I organization. Longing. The emptiness is longing to be filled. Recognize that activity within me.

  1. My cup is chosen for the turtles that remind me of the **honu** in Hawai'i. It is mellow in color, brownish, I felt its color. And now, after many washings, the illustration is slowly pealing off. I didn't recognize this at first, many months ago, when I thought it was part of the design. Honu, fleeting, racing across the sand to survive. Twice I have swum with them.

- *John 15:1-11* or 
    Vine and branches. It is such an evocative and poetic passage that I usually skip by. The meditation is about the cavity, the emptiness of the cup, holding the presence of God. Can I feel that? It's been a long time since I felt it. Cursillo days in the 90's?
- *1 Cor 3:1-17*.
    "because God’s temple is holy, which is what you are."
    I preached this. Do I believe it? Experience it? Know it?
  
  I'm mostly filled with questions at this point. The cup.

  I haven't written for several days. It is my discipline that has been a lifelong weakness. But I have had that **cup** in mind. Today I was thinking that the pictures that are slowly being washed away are of the infant honu scurrying to the water. In fact, I see today, that the title of the cup is "Race for survival" -- partly washed away. There seems to be flurry of irony around the images. But connect it to my life? The reading for day 3 suggests to me that I need to recognize the life that is flowing through me -- "the vibrant stream of divine love." 
  
  > Personal growth does take some effort on my part. I do need to give myself to the process, but I cannot force growth to happen.
  
  > What part of my life most needs the powerful touch of God?
  
  I remember still some of the feeling of those fleeting moments when I was on a surfboard. So out of my water. So disoriented by my eyesight. But it was enough to know that the main thing to grasp was the sense of the waves, the power of the ocean. God the ocean.
  
  Remember I am a vessel holding God's love, the **stream**.
  
  The movie tonight came with some built-in alienation impulses. MP and I didn't hit it off. Mis-firing. Going in different directions. But I ended up thinking particularly about the **flautist**  at Lakewood High (the name of the school in the film, byw). She gave me T.S Eliot, in the form of the *Hollow Men.* It wasn't as eye-popping to me at the time as it has subsequently become. I don't even know her name. But I think she was my first love. The woman I should have pursued but didn't for all the wrong male adolescent reasons.

  Today's meditation focuses on the need for discipline. My reflections focus on my failure in that regard. For several days I've kept the discipline of reflecting (for a sentence or 2) on my reading. For a day or 2 I keep the discipline of playing piano. I feel hopeful after these couple of days -- then the remorse of my failure. 
  
  The cup and its boundaries, its disciplines, are what makes it possible to hold the substance intended for it.
  
  This morning I had thought that perhaps my **boundary** needed to be to write and reflect in the quiet of the time just before I got to bed. Tonight I'm trying that. Perhaps so.
  
  The circularity of the cup. The cylindrical shape. How does that fit my life? "Close your eyes and imagine your spiritual boundaries." the text prompts.
