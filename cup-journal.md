# journaling the cup

- *John 15:1-11* or 
    Vine and branches. It is such an evocative and poetic passage that I usually skip by. The meditation is about the cavity, the emptiness of the cup, holding the presence of God. Can I feel that? It's been a long time since I felt it. Cursillo days in the 90's?
- *1 Cor 3:1-17*.
    "because Godâ€™s temple is holy, which is what you are."
    I preached this. Do I believe it? Experience it? Know it?

I'm mostly filled with questions at this point. The cup.

I haven't written for several days. It is my discipline that has been a lifelong weakness. But I have had that **cup** in mind. Today I was thinking that the pictures that are slowly being washed away are of the infant honu scurrying to the water. In fact, I see today, that the title of the cup is "Race for survival" -- partly washed away. There seems to be flurry of irony around the images. But connect it to my life? The reading for day 3 suggests to me that I need to recognize the life that is flowing through me -- "the vibrant stream of divine love." 

> Personal growth does take some effort on my part. I do need to give myself to the process, but I cannot force growth to happen.

> What part of my life most needs the powerful touch of God?

I remember still some of the feeling of those fleeting moments when I was on a surfboard. So out of my water. So disoriented by my eyesight. But it was enough to know that the main thing to grasp was the sense of the waves, the power of the ocean. God the ocean.

Remember I am a vessel holding God's love, the **stream**.
