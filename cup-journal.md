# journaling the cup

- *John 15:1-11* or 
    Vine and branches. It is such an evocative and poetic passage that I usually skip by. The meditation is about the cavity, the emptiness of the cup, holding the presence of God. Can I feel that? It's been a long time since I felt it. Cursillo days in the 90's?
- *1 Cor 3:1-17*.
    "because Godâ€™s temple is holy, which is what you are."
    I preached this. Do I believe it? Experience it? Know it?

I'm mostly filled with questions at this point. The cup.
