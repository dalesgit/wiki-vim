# listening skills
- 5 % of people have training in listening skills
- we will forget ca. 75% of what we've heard
- Don't be thinking about what you are going to respond as you are listening
- it's ok to pause -- slow it down
- leave room for differences
- put yourself in the shoes of another (e.g. Marcus)
- discernment: where is God acting
- suspend certainty of where the conversation is going
- only speak from a **new** awareness
- What happens when you get distracted? When it's too much?
	- LS focuses on images. What image to focus on.
- LS: attention to 3 basic scenarios that people are in when they come for SD:
1. Crisis
2. Chaos going on
3. Clarification of where going? I'm not sure about these.
