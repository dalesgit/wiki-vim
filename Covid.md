# Covid

- Mar 2020 it hit. My classes went on line.
- Apr 2020 we had neighborhood get together on the lawn out front of our house. We shopped at Publix but there was a quota of how many allowed in the store at one time and we were to follow arrows in the aisles. 
- June or so I was video taping a service for St. Paul's. 
- The following winter I was in Dayton, Zooming with my class, presumably contracted Covid-19. 
- Dec. of 2021 I canceled Christmas. The organist and a member of choir had tested positive for Covid. We couldn't get tested until Christmas Eve morn. Tough decision. 
- For a period in 2022 things were close to normal at church. 
- When was the first time I bought a meal from Longhorns Steak, waiting in the parking lot to pay for "take out."
